  "article": "## Retinal Anatomy\n\nOptical Coherence Tomography is a rapid, non-invasive, in-office optical imaging technology that utilizes light waves to capture high resolution images of various structures of the eye. With the advent of higher resolution OCT technology, the layers of the retina that were once only able to be visualized histologically, can now be visualized in high resolution as well allowing analysis of tissues qualitatively and quantitatively.\n\nA normal OCT macula is seen below. Pay attention to the labelled structures. Compare it with the histological specimen below. \n\n![](/content/media/review-of-anatomy1.png)\n\n![](/content/media/review-of-anatomy2.png)\n\n## Retinal Layers and Function\n\nA thorough understanding of retinal anatomy and function will aid in the interpretation of OCT images. The layers of the retina MUST be memorized.\n\nThe layers of the retina from inner to outer segments are outlined below:\n\n![](/content/media/review-of-anatomy3.png)\n\n![](/content/media/review-of-anatomy4.png)\n\n## Function of Each Layer\n\nThis section will help apply your knowledge of retinal anatomy to OCT images.Â  As you move through the retinal layers, you will realize there are more distinct layers on OCT that are not highlighted from a histological standpoint, creating difficulties in anatomical correlates."
