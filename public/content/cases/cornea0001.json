          "answerText": "B. Cystinosis",
          "explanation": "Cystinosis is a rare lysosomal storage disease in which cystine accumulates in organs and tissues throughout the body. AS-OCT in cystinosis shows innumerable hyper-reflective, rod- and needle-like deposits distributed throughout the corneal stroma, corresponding to microscopic cystine crystals (1). This matches the clinical findings seen on slit lamp examination and helps confirm the diagnosis of ocular cystinosis. The crystals accumulate predominantly in the anterior stroma and can cause dysphotopsia (artifacts of light) from scattering of incoming light."

          "explanation": "The clinical presentation described is most consistent with adult/ocular cystinosis. This form of the disorder is characterized by isolated ocular involvement, without the systemic renal impairment that defines the nephropathic forms (infantile and juvenile). With Fanconi syndrome, there are no corneal crystals. The patient's age (30 years old) and the absence of renal disease or Fanconi syndrome are classic for this benign, non-nephropathic variant (4)."

          "answerText": "A. Anterior corneal stroma",
          "explanation": "In children with cystinosis, crystal deposition is most prominent in the anterior corneal stroma (5). This pattern contrasts with older adults, where crystals tend to accumulate more in the posterior stroma due to progressive deposition over time. The anterior localization in children is observable both on slit-lamp examination and anterior segment OCT, where hyperreflective deposits are typically seen closer to the corneal surface in younger patients. Over the years, as new corneal lamellae form and existing ones move posteriorly, crystals are redistributed toward the posterior stroma."
