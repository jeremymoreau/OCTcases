          "explanation": "AS-OCT in microcystic edema shows hypo-reflective subepithelial spaces representing intraepithelial bullae. The white arrow highlights a hypo-reflective subepithelial fluid pocket beneath the epithelium. \n\nMicrocystic bullae are a recognized complication of eye surgeries such as cataract surgery or laser-assisted in situ keratoplasty (LASIK). Persistent microcystic changes may suggest underlying corneal decompensation or retained surgical material (1).\n\n![](/content/media/cornea2-2.avif)"

          "answerText": "B. Endothelial pump dysfunction",
          "explanation": "Corneal microcystic edema after eye surgeries such as DMEK or cataract surgery is typically linked to endothelial cell trauma, leading to stromal and epithelial fluid accumulation (2). The most accepted mechanism is that surgical trauma impairs endothelial barrier function, which typically keeps the cornea dehydrated for a clear view. This results in excessive corneal edema, which manifests as microcystic changes or bullae in the epithelial layer."

  "description": "58M with Fuchs' dystrophy referred for worsening vision",
  "patientPresentation": "Patient presentation: A 58-year-old male patient with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy was referred for evaluation of worsening vision. He underwent Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) in the right eye. At post-operative week 1, the patient reported foreign body sensation and “foggy” vision.\n\nAnterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) was performed to evaluate the cornea and is shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/cornea2_1.avif)",

Understand the imaging features of microcystic corneal edema, which include hypo-reflective subepithelial cysts on AS-OCT.\n\n2. Recognize that transient microcystic corneal edema may occur with surgical trauma.\n\n3. Recognize that topical hypertonic saline drops are used for reducing transient microcystic corneal edema."
