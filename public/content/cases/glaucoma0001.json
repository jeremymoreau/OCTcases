          "explanation": "The ONH/RNFL deviation map (black arrows) and TSNIT plot (red circle) shows a focal region of reduced RNFL thickness superior to the disc bilaterally; however, this does not follow the infero-temporal or supero-temporal arcuate pattern seen when the vulnerability zones (superiorly or inferiorly) are affected. The RNFL is relatively thin slightly nasal into the disc, not temporally as expected with vulnerability zone deficits.\n\n![](/content/media/glacoma1_3.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/glacoma1_4.webp)"

          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "B. Split superior RNFL bundle",
          "explanation": "Glaucoma is unlikely as the pattern of reduced RNFL thickness is atypical for glaucoma (spares macular vulnerability zone) and ganglion cell analysis shows normal thickness. Retinal vascular disease is also unlikely as the area of reduced RNFL thickness would be expected to be more diffuse and correlate with a specific compromised vessel. This patient has a split superior RNFL bundle. RNFL thickness falls out of normal range at the bundle split, leading to what is termed ‘red disease’. Red disease is non-existent disease incorrectly identified by technology. Split RNFL bundles are anatomic variants in healthy human eyes and may show red disease on OCT RNFL/ONH."

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "D. All of the above",
          "explanation": "As you can see on the RNFL thickness and deviation maps, reduced superior RNFL thickness is observed between the superior retinal vessels (black arrow). The distance between superior retinal vessels is relatively wide (red brackets), which occurs because of the splitting of superior RNFL fibers. A double-hump sign (red circles), showing two superior RNFL thickness peaks, is also seen on the TSNIT plot. \n\n![](/content/media/glacoma1_5.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/glacoma1_6.webp)\n\n​References:\n\n1.
