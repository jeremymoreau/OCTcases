          "explanation": "Glaucoma often presents with reduced inferior RNFL thickness first (red circle), followed by superior, nasal, and then temporal RNFL loss. RNFL asymmetry is often seen in glaucoma as well (yellow box). The cup-to-disc ratio estimated on OCT is also elevated in left eye (red circle), which may lend to a diagnosis of glaucoma. \n\n![](/content/media/glacoma2_2.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/glacoma2_3.webp)\n\nReferences:\n\n1.    Harizman N, Oliveira C, Chiang A, Tello C, Marmor M, Ritch R, Liebmann J.

          "explanation": "As you can see on the RNFL deviation map (green box) and the OS Deviation map on the Ganglion Cell analysis (red box), there is diffuse RNFL loss more prominently in the inferotemporal region. Additionally, the OS ILM-RPE thickness plot on the macular cube shows reduced pan-retinal thickness (pink box). This can be corroborated by the OS Horizontal B-scan which clearly shows reduced thickness of the retina extending to the outer plexiform layer (yellow box). \n\n![](/content/media/glacoma2_6.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/glacoma2_7.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/glacoma2_8.webp)\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

          "answerText": "B. Previous retinal vein occlusion",
          "explanation": "At first glance, OCT RNFL and ONH may suggest glaucoma due to reduced inferior RNFL thickness in the setting of a cup-to-disc ratio of 0.8. However, the pattern of RNFL loss and findings on GCC and macular cube analyses lend to an alternate explanation. Typically with glaucoma, RNFL and ganglion cell loss occurs throughout the macular vulnerability zone areas first. The diffuse RNFL and ganglion cell loss, which doesn’t respect the infero-temporal region or macular vulnerability zones, suggests a non-glaucomatous etiology. Furthermore, glaucoma usually affects the superficial retinal layers. On this patient’s OCT images, the inner retinal layers are also affected. Considering the diffuse pattern of reduced pan-retinal thickness, a chronic vascular ischemic etiology would explain the OCT findings. \n\nThe high cup-to-disc ratio is a distractor in this case (likely physiologic cupping as the disc area is large). \n\nReferences: \n\n1.

She had no past ocular history, but did not regularly see her optometrist. On assessment, her visual acuity was 20/25 OD 20/60 OS. IOP was 14 OU (on 0/0 classes or glaucoma medications). Fundus examination showed cup-to-disc ratios of 0.7 OD and 0.8 OS. ONH and RNFL OCT analysis is shown below. \n\n![](/content/media/glacoma2_1_png_tif.webp)",
