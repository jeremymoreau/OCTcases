          "explanation": "When we look at the RNFL Deviation Map, we notice that the OCT from today suggested a thin RNFL, whereas the OCT from 6 months ago did not and instead shows that the RNFL thickness are within normal ranges.\n\n​However, when we look at RNFL Thickness Map (an objective measurement), we notice they are very similar to today’s OCT compared to the OCT from 6 months ago. The distribution and shape of the thickness (the yellow and red colours) in both eyes are consistent from 6 months ago compared to today.\n\n​It may therefore be a good idea to look at the topography and the tomograms first to confirm correct segmentation and capture of the desired region."

          "answerText": "C. The incorrect date of birth has been entered in the OCT ONH/RNFL from today’s visit.",
          "explanation": "If you haven’t yet noticed – the date of birth in the OCT from today’s visit is entered incorrectly!\n\nThe patient’s correct date of birth is 07/18/1929 (entered in the OCT from 6 months ago) whereas the date of birth entered at today’s visit is 07/18/1999.\n\nAs mentioned previously, findings from any OCT ONH/RNFL are compared against age-matched controls to derive the “yellow” and “red” colours that indicate whether there is a thin RNFL compared to a “normal” person their age. As somebody’s RNFL naturally thins with age (roughly 2-4 microns per decade), it is important to compare patients against a normative value for their age. In this case, we were effectively comparing the OCT findings of an 89-year-old woman against a 19-year-old!\n\nWhen the average RNFL thickness is coloured in yellow or red, this would indicate that this patient’s measurements are below 5% and below 1% respectively of their age-matched controls.\n\nNote that this is the case for everything yellow and red except the topographical map, as the yellow and red colours indicate absolute RNFL thickness in terms of µm, not as a comparison to age-matched controls. Additionally, the RNFL circular tomogram is also not compared against age-matched controls.\n\nFinally, although the signal strength is not ideal (4/10 and 6/10), the segmentation is good on the tomogram, indicating that poorer signal strength is not an issue."

          "answerText": "Show answer",
          "explanation": "Since the OCT from this clinical vignette was taken by a Carl Zeiss Cirrus machine, the patient’s results were compared to the Carl Zeiss Cirrus normative database, which consists of data from a 7-site study in the United States enrolling 284 subjects aged 19-84.(1) An ethnicity breakdown of the subjects reveals the subjects to be 43% Caucasians, 24% Asians, 18% African American, 12% Hispanic, 1% Indian, and 6% mixed ethnicity. The refractive error ranged from -12.00D to +8.00 D; high myopes were not included in the normative database.(1)(2)\n\nThere are other normative databases that are used for other OCT machines. Common databases include the Stratus normative database,(3) the Optovue RTVue database,(4) and the Heidelburg Spectralis database.(5)\n\nIt is important to note that although these databases attempted to include representation from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, they tend to include mostly Caucasian patients. Depending on the location you practice in and the diversity of your patient population, it may be important to consider this when interpreting results(6).\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Her IOP is 15mmHg in both eyes on no glaucoma medication and she has an absence of any visual symptoms. She has no family history of glaucoma. Her past ocular history is unremarkable other than bilateral cataract extraction.\n​\nShe receives an OCT ONH and RNFL of both her eyes.
