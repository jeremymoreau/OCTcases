          "explanation": "The ONH/RNFL deviation map shows reduced RNFL thickness infero- and supero-temporally (red boxes); these regions are termed the inferior and superior vulnerability zones, respectively. RNFL bundles in these regions are thicker and susceptible to glaucomatous damage. In particular, the inferior vulnerability zone also corresponds to the inferior macula, which is known as the ‘macular vulnerability zone (MVZ)’. This region is also prone to glaucomatous damage and appears to have reduced thickness on the macular cube (red arrows).\n\nReferences\n\n1. Hood DC, Raza AS, de Moraes CG, Liebmann JM, Ritch R.

          "explanation": "Along with the reduced RNFL thickness in the inferior and superior vulnerability zones, the inferior neuro-retinal rim is also thin as seen on this patient’s TSNIT plot (blue circle). Glaucomatous processes may follow a step-wise pattern leading to sequential thinning of inferior -> superior -> nasal -> temporal neuro-retinal rim (“ISNT pattern”). A high cup-to-disc ratio in the setting of these OCT findings is also in keeping with glaucoma.\n\n![](/content/media/glaucoma-5-6.webp)"

          "answerText": "A. Pre-Perimetric Glaucoma",
          "explanation": "The patient does not have any focal visual field deficits as seen on the Pattern Deviation. However, the OCT RNFL/ONH demonstrates findings consistent with glaucoma (thin MVZ, thin inferior and superior RNFL). Clinical examination revealed elevated IOP in the left-eye as well. The lack of focal visual field loss with subtle reduction in threshold sensitivity at points in the periphery (red arrows) suggests pre-perimetric glaucoma. The pearl of this case is that a normal visual field cannot exclude glaucoma. In fact, studies have shown that 40-50% of nerve fibers may be lost in the absence of a visual field deficit. Ophthalmologists can rely on OCT and clinical assessment to rule in specific ocular pathology, including glaucoma. In summary, the patient’s examination is consistent with Pre-Perimetric Glaucoma. However to diagnose this definitively, repeat assessment with visual fields, OCTs, and clinical examination is warranted to assess for progression, as glaucoma is a progressive disease. \n\nReferences\n\n1. Quigley HA, Addicks EM, Green WR.
