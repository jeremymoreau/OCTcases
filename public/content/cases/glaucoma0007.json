          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "D. All of the above",
          "explanation": "Although structural damage may predate visual field loss, if there were real glaucomatous damage, the superior RNFL thinning observed on testing would correspond to inferior visual field loss. GCL+IPL thickness was normal as well. While these quantitative values are useful in evaluating stability versus progression in glaucoma, we must also evaluate the spatial information from the tests themselves. This includes an analysis of visual field loss on the pattern deviation plot and a review of the TSNIT, RNFL thickness, and deviation maps. Reliability indices, signal strength, and segmentation must also be adequate to draw valid conclusions from testing."

          "answerText": "D. Motion artefact",
          "explanation": "The patient moved her eye downward during the OCT capture, shifting the region superior to the nerve into the more proximal peripapillary region (red rectangle). Because of the motion artefact, there is a perceived decrease in the superior RNFL thickness that may not be real (red circles on the RNFL thickness map and TSNIT plot). This corresponds to a subtle decrease in RNFL thickness on the RNFL circular tomogram (red arrows). While RNFL thickness appears reduced due to motion, the retinal circular tomogram demonstrates good segmentation of the retinal layers, and there is no media opacity causing significant acquisition error. It is important to perform a ‘radiologic’ evaluation of the RNFL analysis, specifically assessing the RNFL tomogram and thickness/deviation map for irregularities, which can impact ‘stockbroker’ metrics such as average RNFL thickness and guided progression analysis trends.\n\n![](/content/media/glaucoma_4.avif)"

The uninterrupted path of the superior arcuate vessels exiting the disc, as well as normal superior RNFL thickness and deviation map, are visible in the reliable analysis. The RNFL circular tomogram in the repeated scan also shows increased RNFL thickness in the region affected by the motion artefact.\n\n![](/content/media/glaucoma_6.avif)\n\nMovement of the eye during OCT can result in motion artefacts. This case is a good example of red disease, in which the superior RNFL is incorrectly interpreted as thin due to motion artefact. It also highlights the important components of OCT ONH/RNFL interpretation, which include both a ‘radiologic’ assessment of the circular tomogram, thickness map, and deviation map, as well as a ‘stockbroker’ assessment of RNFL thickness values, the TSNIT plot, and guided progression analysis trends. Radiologic assessment provides important context for stockbroker RNFL metrics, allowing for holistic OCT analysis."
