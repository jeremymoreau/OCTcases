The OCT RNFL reveals temporal thinning in the right eye and superior and inferior thinning in the left eye. This localizes the process to the retrochiasmal visual pathways since the macular changes are homonymous (similar in both eyes)."

The OCT shows thinning in the supero-nasal quadrant of the macula OD and supero-temporal quadrant of the macula OS. Because the superior retina sees the inferior visual field (and vice versa) and the nasal retinal sees the temporal visual field (and vice versa), this patient has a right inferior homonymous quadrantanopia as shown above."

This results in a pattern of bowtie atrophy in the eye contralateral to the central nervous system lesion."

          "explanation": "This patient had a left occipital lobe stroke 5-years prior to this presentation, and the OCT changes are due to retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration (RTSD). This means that there has been death of axons in the occipital lobe and this has subsequently resulted in death of the retinal ganglion cell and its axon that travels from the lateral geniculate nucleus to the retina. This process takes at least several months and likely years to occur. The MRI brain is shown, which shows an old left occipital stroke:\n\nRetrograde trans-synaptic retinal ganglion cell loss was further classified by Jindahra et al. in 2009 where patients with acquired homonomous hemianopia had nasal and temporal thinning in the eye contralateral to the occipital lesion and superior and inferior thinning in the eye ipsilateral to the lesion (as seen in our patient). There was no significant difference in patients with acquired or congential lesions. This was the first study showing RTSD in adult-onset lesions.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-1-5.webp)\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Miller NR, Newman SA. Transsynaptic degeneration.
