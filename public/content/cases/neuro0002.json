          "explanation": "This patient has binasal thinning of the macular ganglion cell complex. Since the nasal retinal sees the temporal portion of the visual field, a bitemporal hemianopia is expected. Notice how the left nasal thinning macular GCC is more prominent compared to the right and this corresponds to a denser temporal hemianopia in the left eye."

          "explanation": "This patient has a bitemporal hemianopia and this localizes to the optic chiasm.\n\nA study by Tieger et al. in 2016 found that in 23 patients with chiasmal compression, binasal GCC loss was typical in these patients, and can be seen even with minimal or no detectable VF loss.\n\nA study by Blanch et al. in 2018 found that in seven patients stellar tumours and chiasmal compression with normal visual function, OCT-GCC detected the compressive chiasmopathy before visual defects apparent on standard automated perimetry. With only OCT-RNFL, 3/7 patients would have had a missed diagnosis. Therefore, OCT-GCC is critical in detection of compressive optic neuropathies from sellar/suprasellar lesions.  \n\nReferences:\n\n1. Tieger MG, Hedges TR.

          "explanation": "The Tieger et al. in 2016 found that after chiasmal decompression, the majority of the 23 patients studied showed improvement in visual field function despite persistent ganglion cell complex loss on OCT. In addition, less GCC loss before surgery correlated with better postoperative visual field function. This study was critical in demonstrating OCT-GCC as an objective method in diagnosis and follow-up of patients with chiasmal compression."
