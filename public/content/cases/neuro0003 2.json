          "explanation": "![](/content/media/neuro-3-4.webp)\n\nYou can see the retinal folds (red arrow) quite nicely on this OCT scan. Notice how the retinal folds are confined to the inner retina and do not extend to the outer retina and choroid. The retinal nerve fiber layer also appears thickened and edematous. OCT can be useful in distinguishing between choroidal and retinal folds. Retinal folds are a reported retinal manifestation of papilledema. Choroidal folds and peri-papillary wrinkles have also been reported to occur in cases of papilledema.

Development of macular sub-retinal fluid in the context of papilledema has been reported in the literature and hypothesized to occur due to a direct communication between the macular sub-retinal space and the swollen optic nerve.\n\nFor more information around this topic, please refer to the following paper: Hoye VJ, Berrocal AM, Hedges TR, Amaro-Quireza ML.

          "explanation": "Similar to CSCR, resolution of chronic sub-retinal fluid can cause changes and disruption of the ellipsoid zone (orange arrow), leading to poorer visual outcomes.\n\nThe OCT below demonstrates another patient with sub-retinal fluid (A) secondary to papilledema. When the sub-retinal fluid resorbed (B), there was subsequent disruption of the outer retina and the ellipsoid zone. The red arrows are pointing towards the accumulation of waste products in the photoreceptor outer segment of the detached retina. This has traditionally been referred to as a “brush border pattern”. The separation of the neurosensory retina from the RPE prevents the photoreceptor waste products from being processed by the RPE. If the waste products persist, they may become permanent sub-retinal deposits (blue arrow) after sub-retinal fluid re-absorption.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-3-9.webp)"
