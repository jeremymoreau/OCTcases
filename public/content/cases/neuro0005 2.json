          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "C. Left optic tract",
          "explanation": "The optic tract is a white matter tract that is located between the optic chiasm and lateral genicular nucleus. Each optic tract contains the ipsilateral eye temporal retinal nerve fibers and contralateral eye nasal retinal nerve fibers. The optic tracts contain pupillary fibers unlike the optic radiations and visual cortex since the pupillary fibers leave for the midbrain from the distal portion of the optic tracts. Therefore, an RAPD is not expected in retrogeniculate lesions. The reason there is an RAPD contralateral to the optic tract lesion is because there are more fibers in the optic tract from the contralateral eye (classically 53:47) since the temporal visual field is larger than the nasal visual field. This ratio may be even larger for fibers serving the pupillary reflex.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-5-4.webp)"

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "A. Bow tie atrophy",
          "explanation": "Bow tie atrophy is seen on RNFL OCT in retro-chiasmal lesions, where the nerve fiber layer is atrophied nasal and temporal in the eye contralateral to the lesion and superior and inferior in the eye ipsilateral to the lesion. This is due to the arrangement of the retinal nerve fibre layer as illustrated below.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-5-5.webp)\n\nReferences\n\n1. Micieli JA, Newman NJ, Biousse V.
