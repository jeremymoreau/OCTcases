          "explanation": "The above RNFL and GCC OCT images do not demonstrate any notable pathology. The retinal nerve fiber layer in both eyes are symmetric with 95% distributed thickness compared to age matched counterparts in all four quadrants OU. The ganglion cell complex OCT demonstrates good thickness of the macular ganglion cells OU. One cannot reliably state there is any disease processes going on in these eyes from these images alone."

          "explanation": "This patient is complaining of reduced vision that cannot be accounted for by the eye exam. OCT RNFL and GCC were also normal. The important lesson from this case is that a normal OCT does not rule out involvement of the anterior visual pathways, particularly in acute situations. It takes time, typically 6-8 weeks, before thinning in OCT parameters are detected after an acute insult to the optic nerves or chiasm.\n\nThis patient had a bitemporal hemianopia as shown below. \n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-6-2.webp)"

          "answerText": "C. Pituitary apoplexy",
          "explanation": "A bitemporal hemianopia indicates that the disease process is located in the optic chiasm. In a patient with a new bitemporal hemianopia and headache, pituitary apoplexy is a particular concern. Pituitary apoplexy is caused by acute hemorrhage or infarction in a pre-existing pituitary adenoma, which the patient was not aware of in this case. The rapid enlargement of the pituitary tumor compresses adjacent structures and can cause visual field defects and cranial nerve palsies. The MRI below indicates a pituitary adenoma with internal hemorrhage compressing the optic chiasm.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-6-3.webp)\n\nReferences\n\nHorton JC.

The patient noted that she believes she cannot see in her periphery as well as normal. The patient’s vision was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. Colour vision was 9/14 OD, 12/14 OS on Ishihara plates. No RAPD was noted.  Dilated eye examination was normal. The OCT RNFL and GCC are shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-6-1.webp)",
