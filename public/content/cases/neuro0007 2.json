However, in this case, the patient does not have a detectable visual field defect as seen on the Humphrey 24-2 SITA-Fast visual fields below.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-7-3.webp)"

          "answerText": "A. MRI sella",
          "explanation": "This case demonstrates a relatively new understanding in neuro-ophthalmology, where the OCT ganglion cell analysis can demonstrate abnormalities before visual field deficits, especially in optic chiasmal lesions. Vision can be preserved; however, early stage ganglion cell and retinal nerve fiber atrophy can be present. The nasal thinning OU correlates to the temporal field deficit that would be present if the disease progresses further, leading to a bitemporal hemianopia which is characteristic of optic chiasm lesions. Since this patient has findings suggestive of a lesion of the optic chiasm (even though there are no visual field defects), an MRI sella should be performed. The coronal T1-weighted MRI of the sella is shown and reveals a Rathke’s cleft cyst is shown in the red arrow, and optic chiasm is shown in the yellow arrow.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-7-4.webp)\n\nReferences\n\n1.

  "patientPresentation": "A 43-year-old female was referred for an eye assessment. She has not had any visual complaints, but had not previously had an eye exam. Visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes, colour vision was normal (14/14 Ishihara colour plates) and dilated fundus examination was normal. An OCT RNFL and GCC analysis were performed and shown below.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-7-1.webp)",
