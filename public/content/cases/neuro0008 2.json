          "explanation": "The fundus photo shows an area of optic disc pallor (red asterisk) and loss of the retinal nerve fiber layer (yellow lines). The OCT macula has demonstrated that there is no macular hole, CME or other retinal pathology and a previous BRAO or ischemic optic neuropathy remain in the differential diagnosis. A vertically-oriented OCT macula line scan would help in assessing the atrophic layers of the retina. If this patient had a previous optic neuropathy, we will see that only the RNFL and ganglion cell layer are atrophied. If this patient had a previous BRAO, there would be more significant inner retinal atrophy.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-8-5.webp)"

Additionally, there is a dis-attached posterior hyaloid face anterior to this region of retinal atrophy.

          "answerText": "B. Branch retinal artery occlusion",
          "explanation": "BRAO is a vascular occlusive disorder of the retina. Acutely, BRAO can present with sudden onset painless visual distortion and/or decreased visual acuity affecting a specific region of one’s visual field. Chronic BRAO can result in irreversible visual field loss due to persistent ischemia and resulting necrosis of retinal tissue. The BRAO affected the superior macula, with resulting inner retinal atrophy. This would explain the inferior central scotoma seen on the HVF24-2. OCT macula with vertically-oriented line scans confirmed the diagnosis as the layers below the ganglion cell layer are atrophic, which would not be seen in an optic neuropathy."
