          "answerText": "D. OCT enhanced depth imaging",
          "explanation": "Initial OCT methods had poor visualization of the deeper layers of the retina beyond Bruch’s membrane due to scattering of light at the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). EDI-OCT allows for visualization of the deep portions of the choroid, which is implicated in many retinal diseases, and the deep structures of the optic nerve."

These objects appear as hypo-reflective structures that are located above the lamina cribrosa and have a hyper-reflective margin.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-9-3.webp)"

      "answers": [
        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "Show answer",
          "explanation": "This patient has highly reflective material at the optic disc which coincide with the findings on EDI-OCT of the optic nerve. This material is optic disc drusen (ODD), which is found in 1-2% of the normal population. ODD do not typically cause any significant visual changes, but progressive visual field defects or non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) may rarely occur in their presence. Since ODD cause crowding of the optic nerve, they produce a “disc-at-risk”, which is necessary for NAION.\n\nFundus auto-fluorescence is useful as mitochondria accumulate in ODD, and these organelles contain large amounts of porphyrins which are otherwise not found at the optic disc. Fundus auto-fluorescence detects fluorophores such as porphyrins, making this test useful for sensitive detection of ODD."

  "title": "Case 9",
  "description": "41M presenting for abnormal optic nerve OD",
  "patientPresentation": "A 41-year-old man saw his optometrist for a routine examination. He was asymptomatic with a visual acuity of 20/20 OU; however, the optometrist was concerned for an abnormal appearing optic nerve in the right eye. Intraocular pressure and visual fields were normal. Optic disc photos were performed and are shown below.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-9-1.webp)",
