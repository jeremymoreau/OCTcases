          "explanation": "The horizontal and vertical B-scans on the RNFL OCT demonstrate abnormal areas of traction at the optic nerve head between the vitreous and the nerve (purple arrows). The RNFL thicknesses are normal but asymmetric, and no optic disc cupping is noted on optic nerve head analysis.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-10-4.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-10-5.webp)"

          "answerText": "A. Vitreopapillary traction",
          "explanation": "Vitreopapillary traction is a manifestation of anomalous posterior vitreous detachment at the optic nerve head which can lead to optic disc elevation and transient relative afferent pupillary defect. It should remain the differential for asymptomatic optic disc edema. The red arrows below demonstrate vitreopapillary traction on the nasal part of the optic discs leading to elevation in that area.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-10-8.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-10-9.webp)"

  "patientPresentation": "A 64-year-old female was referred to neuro-ophthalmology clinic for bilateral blurred optic disc margins. Her past medical history was significant for obesity. Visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/30 OS with equal pupil sizes and no RAPD. Colour vision was 14/14 on Ishihara plates OU.
