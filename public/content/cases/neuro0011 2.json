In a study conducted by Kim et al, all 10 patients with superior segmental optic nerve hypoplasia were born to mothers with diabetes mellitus. Optic nerve hypoplasia may also be associated with fetal alcohol syndrome and premature birth.\n\nReferences\n\nKim RY, Hoyt WF, Lessell S, Narahara MH.

          "answerText": "D. Hormonal insufficiency",
          "explanation": "While optic nerve hypoplasia cannot be reversed or treated, it is a non-progressive entity. These patients are at risk for development of hormonal insufficiencies (thyroid hormone, growth hormone, adrenal gland, anti-diuretic hormone deficiencies) as a result of hypothalamic dysfunction. These patients should be referred for endocrine work-up as hormonal deficiencies may not manifest until adulthood."
