          "explanation": "In most cases, the etiology is unclear, however compressive lesions, hypotony, hyperopia and scleral inflammation are known to cause retinal folds. When determining the cause of retinal folds, history and further investigations can aid in determining etiology. The patient’s past medical history is significant for multiple myeloma (MM). Plasmacytoma (plasma cell tumour) may occur in end-stage MM patients and is the most likely cause for the retinal folds seen in this patient (Knapp 1987).\n\nReferences\n\nKnapp AJ, Gartner S, Henkind P.

A T2-weighted MRI orbits was performed, showing large orbital plasmacytomas (red arrows) involving the medial rectus muscle bilaterally.

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "A. Cranial nerve palsy",
          "explanation": "Complications of multiple myeloma result from the accumulation of immunoglobulin light chains in organ systems (ex. kidney, bone, gastro-intestinal tract, central/peripheral nervous system...). Immunoglobulins and plasma cells can accumulate in the many ocular structures including the ciliary body, retina, cranial nerves, surrounding musculature and soft tissue. Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations are generally most common – cranial nerve 6 palsy is the most common neuro-ophthalmic complication observed in multiple myeloma, likely due to the long course of the nerve (Fung 2005). Regarding the patient in the case presented, plasmacytomas are present in the medial rectus behind the globe and are compressing the optic nerve. This resulted in right RAPD and reduced visual acuity, as well as the retinal folds seen on OCT/fundus photography. Diplopia may arise with further retro-orbital infiltration due to plasmacytomas. This patient is at risk for developing a retinal detachment, as the retinal folds indicate extrinsic force on the retina."
