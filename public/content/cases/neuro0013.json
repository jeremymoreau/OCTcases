          "explanation": "The patient has elevation of the left peripapillary tissues. There are peripapillary wrinkles seen (yellow arrow) which are a sign of optic disc edema. There is also a peripapillary hyper-reflective ovoid mass-like structure (PHOMS) which is a non-specific OCT sign of axonal distention and crowding that can be seen in both acquired and dysplastic anomalies of the optic nerve head (red arrow).  The globe also has an irregular contour (green arrow). All these signs point to optic disc edema.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-13-5.webp)"

The MRI orbit shows a unilateral, well-circumscribed mass located within the muscle cone (red arrow) which is most consistent with a cavernous hemangioma, the most common benign orbital tumour in adults. Although this patient presented asymptomatically, it is possible that an orbital tumour of a larger size cause axial proptosis, decreased or double vision, elevated intraocular pressure, decreased extraocular movements and an afferent pupillary defect.  In these cases, surgical excision is the treatment of choice.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro-ophthalmology-13-13.webp)"
