These changes have been identified in patients with multiple sclerosis, Leber’s Hereditary Optic Neuropathy, Dominant Optic Atrophy, and optic glioma and do not represent drug-induced macular edema.\n\nIt is important for clinicians to recognize and differentiate these degenerative INL changes from cystoid macular edema of another etiology as it can impact the treatment regimen of patients with MS."

  "description": "49M presenting for evaluation of possible macular edema",
  "patientPresentation": "A 49-year-old male was referred to ophthalmology for evaluation of possible macular edema. He has a history of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosed in 1993 and has a remote history of optic neuritis in both eyes. His neurologist is planning on starting a new medication for MS and macular edema is considered a contraindication. A referral is sent to ophthalmology to rule out macular edema.",
