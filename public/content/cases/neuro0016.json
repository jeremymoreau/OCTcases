Even though the overall thickness of 84um is green and “considered” normal, the clear asymmetry suggests that this is abnormal for this patient.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro16-5.webp)\n\nAdditionally, there is also thinning on the ganglion cell analysis in the right eye (shown below). This can be seen in the thickness map, deviation map and overall thickness.

          "explanation": "Given the gradual course of her vision loss, the normal intraocular pressures, and the asymmetrical nature of the optic neuropathy with thinning of the RNFL and GCC in the affected eye, the most likely cause was a compressive optic neuropathy. An MRI brain was performed which showed an anterior clinoid meningioma with compression of the right optic nerve. \n\n![](/content/media/neuro16-7.webp)\n\nMRI T1 post contrast (left) and T2 (right) show an enhancing mass arising from the right anterior clinoid compressing the right optic nerve. This was most consistent with a meningioma."

          "explanation": "RNFL and macular GCC have been found to highly correlate with visual function in patients with compressive optic neuropathies. Preoperative RNFL and macular GCC thickness have emerged as the most reliable and consistent prognostic factors for visual recovery after surgery. Patients with an otherwise normal neuroophthalmic examination, including automated perimetry, may have macular GCC or RNFL thinning as the only manifestation of compression, enabling compressive optic neuropathies to be diagnosed at an earlier stage and managed accordingly."

She denied any neurological symptoms and review of systems was otherwise unremarkable. She has a history of hypertension that was controlled on medication. On presentation, her visual acuity was 20/320 OD and 20/25 OS. She had normal intraocular pressures. She had a right RAPD.
