          "answerText": "C. Dominant optic atrophy",
          "explanation": "This diagnosis is consistent with the history of a slowly progressive decline in vision that starts in the first decade of life. Like other hereditary optic neuropathies, DOA often presents with pallor of the optic nerves, cecocentral scotomas, and color vision loss. The differential diagnosis also includes nutritional deficiencies or toxic medications, but this patient had normal B12, folate levels and was taking no medications."

          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "D. OPA1 gene mutation",
          "explanation": "DOA is an autosomal-dominant inherited condition where the mutations occur on the OPA1 gene. The diagnosis can be distinguished from other hereditary optic neuropathies such as Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) clinically and by genetic testing. There is no established treatment for DOA, but vision largely remains stable or declines at a very slow rate."

  "description": "21M presenting with gradual bilateral vision loss over 10 years",
  "patientPresentation": "**Contributor:** Marko Tien (University of British Columbia Medical Student)\n\nA 21-year-old man was referred to an ophthalmology clinic for evaluation of bilateral vision loss. The patient endorsed decreased vision in both eyes starting ten years ago, which has worsened gradually over time in both eyes. He also reports some reduced hearing bilaterally. He ate a healthy, balanced diet and was taking no medications. On examination, his visual acuity was 20/150 OU with normal sized pupils and no RAPD. Visual fields showed a ceco-central defect bilaterally. \n\n![](/content/media/neuro17-1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/neuro17-2.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/neuro17-3.webp)",
