          "explanation": "This patient is presenting with pain with eye movements and reduced vision from an optic neuropathy, which is a typical presentation for optic neuritis. Approximately one-third of patients with optic neuritis have mild optic disc edema with the remainder have normal appearing optic nerves. In this case, the right eye has mild optic disc edema and the left optic nerve appears normal. Therefore, we would expect to see mild thickening of the RNFL on OCT in the right eye and the overall thickness should be normal in the left eye. This is what is seen as shown below. \n\n![](/content/media/n18_2.webp)"

          "explanation": "Since this is an acute presentation of optic neuritis, no significant atrophy of the retinal ganglion cells is expected at this time. Therefore, we should see a normal overall average thickness in both eyes on OCT GCL-IPL. This is shown below. There are some subtle areas of thinning that are starting to occur, as highlighted by the arrows. \n\n![](/content/media/n18_3.webp)"

          "explanation": "In patients with optic neuritis, MRI of the brain is required to assess for signs of demyelination in the brain, which may indicate a diagnosis or high risk of multiple sclerosis or other demyelinating condition such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. The orbits are also usually included since the pattern of increased T2-signal and contrast enhancement helps determine the underlying cause. For example, if there is longitudinal enhancement or enhancement of the optic nerve sheath it would suggest an alternative cause such as optic neuritis related to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG. \n\n![](/content/media/n18_4.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/n18_5.webp)"

Ten days later, he noticed that his left eye also became blurry. On examination, his visual acuity was CF OD and 20/80 OS and there was a right RAPD.
