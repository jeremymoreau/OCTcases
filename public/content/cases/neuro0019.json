          "answerText": "B. Non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION)",
          "explanation": "The presence of optic disc edema, a disc-at-risk and vascular risk factors (history of hypotensive episodes during dialysis), without any pain or systemic symptoms is highly suggestive of NAION. NAION typically presents as a painless, unilateral disturbance of vision and represents an ischemic event of the anterior portion of the optic nerve. \n\n​Giant cell arteritis is a condition that occurs in individuals over than 50 years of age. With giant cell arteritis, we would often see accompanying symptoms such as headache and jaw claudication. With optic neuritis, we would expect painful vision loss with eye movement. This presentation is not consistent with papilledema (such as from idiopathic intracranial hypertension), which is not known to be sectoral or cause pallid optic disc edema as seen here."

          "explanation": "In the macular GCL-IPL analysis, the most notable abnormality is inferior GCL-IPL loss. Likewise, in the RNFL analysis, there is RNFL loss inferiorly. This pattern of sectoral GCL-IPL and RNFL loss (superior or inferior) corresponding to the altitudinal field loss is characteristic of NAION. \n\nIn the setting of acute vision loss in NAION, RNFL thickness values tend to be increased in conjunction with the optic disc edema while GCL-IPL thickness remains unchanged. With resolution of the optic disc edema, thinning of the RNFL and macular thickness can be seen 3 months after the initial presentation. GCL-IPL loss precedes RNFL loss and can be detected as early as 1 month after presentation.\n\n![](/content/media/no19_8.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/no19_9.webp)"

          "explanation": "NAION is non-progressive and typically does not worsen after the initial, acute episode. As a result, the RNFL and GCC thickness will not worsen but previous RNFL and GCL-IPL loss will persist. Most patients with NAION will experience mild-to-no improvement in vision at long-term follow up."

          "explanation": "To date, there have been no effective medical treatments for NAION. Instead, patients should focus on optimizing their own modifiable risk factors for NAION, which include hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obstructive sleep apnea and diabetes. The dialysis team should be contacted immediately and informed of this complication of the patient’s treatment. Specific options for this patient include minimizing intradialysis hypotension, longer dialysis times and potentially more frequent visits, changes in concentration or temperature of the dialysate, discouraging the patient from eating during dialysis (which may shunt blood towards the GI system), and optimization of her anemia."
