          "explanation": "The main abnormalities in the fundus photographs are located at the optic nerves. In both eyes, the optic disc margins are blurred and not distinct. As blurred and indistinct optic disc margins may be indicative of optic disc edema, further investigation is warranted to determine whether this is a case of true optic disc edema caused by various processes or pseudo-edema. (1) OCT, particularly swept source OCT (SS-OCT) and enhanced depth imaging OCT (EDI-OCT), are useful non-invasive tools for distinguishing between true optic disc edema and pseudo-edema. (1)"

          "answerText": "A. Buried hypo-reflective structures at the optic nerve",
          "explanation": "In both eyes buried hypo-reflective structures can be seen (yellow arrows). There are 3 important findings to note on these OCTs. Firstly, there is optic disc elevation caused by the buried hypo-reflective structures. (4) Secondly, when viewed closely, these structures are surrounded by a hyper-reflective margin both anteriorly and posteriorly. Thirdly, these structures are usually surrounded by short hyper-reflective bands that are perpendicular to the OCT beam. (2,3)\n\nRetinal blood vessels near the optic nerve and peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structure (PHOMS) (green outlines) often mimic these buried hypo-reflective structures making diagnosis difficult. A key characteristic to correctly identify blood vessels is the sideways “figure-eight” shape formed by the arteriole-venule pair (red circles). Two distinguishing characteristics of PHOMS are: 1. They are hyper-reflective and 2. They do not autofluorescence (buried hypo-reflective structures do). (1)\n\nNote: Depending on which OCT modality is used, the posterior hyper-reflective margin may or may not be seen. With SS-OCT and EDI-OCT, visualization of the posterior hyper-reflective margin is more likely than with SD-OCT, particularly for deeply buried hypo-reflective structures.

          "answerText": "A. Pseudo-papilledema",
          "explanation": "In the OCT images, the internal contour of the optic disc has a “lumpy bumpy” appearance, while papilledema usually presents with a smooth contour along the subretinal hypo-reflective space (SHYPS). (3)  Although there is optic disc elevation, it is not as pronounced as would be seen in papilledema. Similarly in papilledema, the posterior hyper-reflective margin is not present like in the above images, and the anterior hyperreflective margin usually extends the entire length of the optic disc. (4) The patient also had no symptoms consistent with raised intracranial pressure."

          "answerText": "A. Optic disc drusen",
          "explanation": "Pseudo-papilledema caused by optic disc drusen (ODD). ODD are deposits of mainly calcium accompanied by mucopolysaccharides, glycoproteins, amino acids, and nucleic acids.1 They have a prevalence of about 1-2% in the general population, are found bilaterally in 75% of these patients, and are usually benign.3 Once diagnosis of ODD is confirmed, analysis of the RNFL and GC/IPL layers of the retina can help classify the severity of ODD. However, ODD can cause visual field disturbances if impinging on the axons of the ganglion cells when leaving through the lamina cribrosa.\n\n​These are some key learning points about ODD: \n\n1. ODD are found above the lamina cribrosa\n2. ODD have a hypo-reflective core\n3. ODD have a hyper-reflective margin both anteriorly and posteriorly\n4. ODD have a “lumpy bumpy” contour along the subretinal hypo-reflective space (SHYPS) which is uncharacteristic of the smooth contour seen in papilledema.\n5. Papilledema usually has more pronounced optic disc elevation compared with ODD.\n6. PHOMS and retinal blood vessels often mimic the appearance of ODD on OCT scans\n7. RNFL and GC/IPL analysis can be used to determine severity of ODD"
