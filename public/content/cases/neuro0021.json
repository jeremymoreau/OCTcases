The RNFL thicknesses are normal but asymmetric, and no optic disc cupping is noted on optic nerve head analysis."

It should remain the differential for asymptomatic optic disc edema. The red arrows below demonstrate vitreopapillary traction on the nasal part of the optic discs leading to elevation in that area. \n\n![](/content/media/neuro21-8.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/neuro21-9.webp)\n\nReferences: \n\n1.
