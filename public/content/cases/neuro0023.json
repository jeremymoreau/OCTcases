          "explanation": "In this OCT HD cross, the multinodular lesion (delineated by the red box) is prominent in both the vertical and horizontal scans. Optically empty spaces resembling a ‘moth eaten’ pattern (delineated by the yellow arrows) are clearly visible on the horizontal scans. In this case, these hypo-reflective spaces represent intralesional calcification. It is also important to note that calcification may cause posterior shadowing and disorganized outer retinal layers. Although not overly prominent in this OCT, there is also dome shaped thickening where the lesion is present.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_ophtho_23_6.webp)"

          "answerText": "A. Astrocytic hamartoma",
          "explanation": "Astrocytic hamartomas are typically benign lesions made of glial cells that can present in the optic nerve and/or retina (5). It is important to note that not all hamartomas present in the same manner. There are three basic types of astrocytic hamartomas that can be differentiated on fundoscopy: type 1, type 2, and type 3. Type 1 is flat/smooth, non-calcified, and translucent. Conversely, type 2 is elevated, calcified multinodular, and opaque. A key characteristic of type 2 hamartomas is their hallmark “mulberry” like appearance as seen in this patient’s fundus photograph above. Type 3 is a mix of type 1 and type 2 (1,4).  Depending on which type of hamartoma the patient has, visualization of the lesion on fundoscopy can differ. Other imaging modalities that aid in the diagnosis of astrocytic hamartomas are OCT/OCTA, ultrasound, and autofluorescence imaging.\n\nAstrocytic hamartomas are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) (1,4,5). TSC is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome that can affect the skin, brain, kidney, lung, and heart (1,2). As such, it is important to ask the patient about systemic manifestations resembling TSC. This patient reported a history of contact dermatitis but denied any other skin changes, seizures, developmental delays, or SOB. Consequently, based on her history and clinical findings, there is low probability of TSC."

Diagnosis of TSC can be made based on clinical presentation or genetic testing.

The patient noted that she was told there was something \"atypical\" with her optic nerve during an eye exam as a teenager. She is asymptomatic. Her past medical history revealed asthma with no significant family history.\n\nVisual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS with normal pupil size and no RAPD.
