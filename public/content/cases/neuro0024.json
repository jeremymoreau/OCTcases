AMNR is characterized by the sudden onset of paracentral scotomas, most often after a fever or viral infection. OCT findings in AMNR include initial hyper-reflectivity in the outer nuclear layer followed by focal ellipsoid zone disruption."

          "explanation": "There are currently no treatments for the VF defects seen in AMNR. Although there are rare associations of AMNR with certain risk factors such as caffeine consumption and oral contraceptive use, there is no known treatment for the vision loss or preventative measures. In this case, there was a temporal association with COVID-19 and precautions to avoid future infection were recommended. \n\nTemporal association with COVID-19 has been reported with AMNR. Similar temporal associations have been reported with AMNR and other febrile infections (e.g., influenza, enteritis sinusitis, bronchitis, etc.), oral contraceptive use, epinephrine/ephedrine use, and high-impact trauma (1)."

  "patientPresentation": "**Contributor:** Arshia Eshtiaghi (CC3)\n\nA 22-year old woman presented to a neuro-ophthalmology clinic with a 2-week history of painless, blurred vision in the left eye. Four weeks prior, she experienced a bout of fever and cough; she tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. On examination, vision was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. Pupils were equal and reactive to light with no RAPD. Humphrey 24-2 SITA-Fast visual field testing revealed a paracentral defect OS, as shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_ophtho_24_1.webp)\n\nFundus examination was within normal limits. OCT imaging of the macula OS was performed and is shown below: \n\n![](/content/media/neuro_ophtho_24_2.webp)",
