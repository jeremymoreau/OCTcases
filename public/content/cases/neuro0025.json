A ceco-central scotoma is a visual field defect that extends from the central axis to the natural blind spot. This type of defect can arise due to damage to the retinal ganglion cells in the papillomacular bundle.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_ophtho_25_5.webp)"

          "answerText": "A: Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy",
          "explanation": "LHON is a mitochondrial disorder with variable penetrance that mostly affects males. Given the characteristic rapid vision loss and the absence of any toxic medications or risks for nutritional deficiency, the most likely diagnosis is a hereditary optic neuropathy. Leber's is also associated with ceco-central scotomas, circumpapillary telangiectatic microangiopathy, and absence of fluorescein leakage on angiography. \n\n​Dominant optic atrophy is much less likely as the progression of DOA is normally much slower with milder vision loss."

Together, these three gene mutations account for 90-95% of all LHON cases. The 11778 mutation carries the worst visual prognosis, with only a 4% chance of spontaneous visual recovery."
