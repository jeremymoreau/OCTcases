          "answerText": "A. Bilateral disc edema",
          "explanation": "The OCT RNFL demonstrates an average RNFL thickness of 151/154, which is well over the average RNFL thickness. This is corroborated by the RNFL thickness maps, which demonstrate bilateral circumferential elevation of the RNFL. The RNFL thickness topographic map also demonstrates increased thickness above the age-matched average, notably superiorly and inferiorly in both eyes."

This corresponds to the inferior optic disc hemorrhage seen on the fundus photo. This case surmises that head and neck manipulation from the massage induced an optic disc hemorrhage in a patient with known papilledema.\n\n![](/content/media/neur_ophth_26_4.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/neur_ophth_26_5.webp)"

  "patientPresentation": "A 41-year-old woman with a known history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) presented with a 2 day history of painless decreased vision OS. The patient noted she had a head and neck massage in prone position 2 hours prior to her visual disturbance. She was using 500mg PO Diamox daily. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/40 OS. There was no RAPD.
