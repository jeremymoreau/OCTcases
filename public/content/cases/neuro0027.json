There are also focal cystic spaces in the outer retina (green arrow). This lesion leads to notable posterior shadowing (blue arrow).\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_opht_27_4.webp)"

          "answerText": "C. Optic disc melanocytoma",
          "explanation": "Melanocytomas are rare, benign, pigmented neoplasms that often present on the optic nerve head in patients with normal visual acuity. These lesions are typically congenital and non-hereditary. They are believed to have low malignant potential in the order of 1-2%. The pathophysiology of melanocytoma development is still unclear. Melanocytomas are typically an isolated condition, but associations to NF2 and basal cell carcinomas have been postulated. Thicknesses greater than 1.5mm carries higher risk of retinal vein occlusions, ischemic optic neuropathies or tumour necrosis.\n\nOCT is crucial in the diagnosis of melanocytomas, as they typically present with a dome-shaped lesion over the optic disc with hyper-reflectivity throughout the anterior and posterior surface of the dome, as well as underlying posterior shadowing.\n\n​\n\nReferences:\n\n​\n\n1.Shields JA, Demirci H, Mashayekhi A, Shields C.

          "answerText": "D. Visual fields",
          "explanation": "Studies have shown that visual fields are abnormal in 90% of patients with optic disc melanocytomas. Field defects typically seen include temporal islands, arcuate defects, nerve fibre bundle defect or enlargement of the blindspot. A study analyzing blood vessel network within areas in melanocytomas confirmed ischemia to regions of the retinal nerve fibre layer that directly correlate to visual field deficit.  Visual fields are also important when monitoring for progression.\n\n​References:\n\n1. Kwak JJ, Lee DH, Lee SC, Lee CS.

  "patientPresentation": "A 30-year-old man was referred to a neuro-ophthalmology clinic for assessment of an optic nerve lesion in his right eye. This lesion was found by his optometrist incidentally during a regular eye examination. He was asymptomatic, including no recent vision changes, flashes, floaters or visual field deficit. The patient denied any past medical or ocular history. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS, IOP was 18 OD and 17 OS, and there was no RAPD. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Fundus photographs were taken and are shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_opht_27_1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_opht_27_2.webp)\n\nA 5-line OCT image with enhanced depth imaging was taken over this lesion and is shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_opht_27_3.webp)",
