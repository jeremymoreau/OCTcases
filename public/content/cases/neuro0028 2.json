You can also appreciate focal yellow/white chorioretinal lesions in the juxtapapillary region OU (green arrows). These chorioretinal lesions are highlighted as stippled hyper-autofluorescence foci on FAF imaging (blue arrows).\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_opht_28_5.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_opht_28_6.webp)"

He did note visual decline over the last 6 months in the left eye.

The ellipsoid zone is formed by the mitochondria of the photoreceptors, and is crucial in maintaining visual function at the macula. The underlying RPE also demonstrates a granular appearance.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_opht_28_11.webp)"

          "explanation": "This patient presented with bilateral optic neuropathy, specifically a pale left optic disc and disc swelling in the right eye confirmed on OCT RNFL imaging. He also had a left outer retinopathy with placoid chorioretinitis appearance in the left macula more so than the right on OCT macula imaging. Finally, he had scattered faint white dots in the retina, highlighted by fundus autofluorescence. These findings in a sexually active man increases the pre-test probability of syphilitic placoid chorioretinopathy.\n\nOcular syphilis is known as the great mimicker of ocular disease. Acute syphilitic placoid chorioretinopathy typically presents with a ground-glass pattern of multifocal or confluent chorioretinal lesions within in the peripapillary region. The hallmark findings are hyper-autofluorescence of the lesions, as well as disrupted ellipsoid zone with granularity of the underlying RPE on OCT macula imaging.\n\n​References:\n\n​Eandi CM, Neri P, Adelman RA, Yannuzzi LA, Cunningham ET.

The patient should also have screening for other associated sexually transmitted diseases. Ocular syphilis is a reportable public health infection; therefore, your local health advisory should be notified based on your location."

  "patientPresentation": "A 54-year-old man presented to a neuro-ophthalmology clinic following a referral for optic nerve swelling. The patient’s only initial symptoms was 2-3 weeks of colourful flickering lights on his left visual field, which was worse in the mornings than evenings. He initially denied vision loss, eye pain, headaches or meningeal symptoms. He denied recent trauma or infection. He denied drug use or risky sexual behaviour. His last eye exam was 6 months prior to presentation, and his vision and eye exam were normal. His past medical history was significant for T2DM and hypertension, of which he was appropriately treated with medications.\n\nOn examination, his best corrected distance visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/200 OS. Intraocular pressure was normal and there was no RAPD. Anterior segment examination was normal.
