          "explanation": "Using the left eye OCT macula as a control, one can appreciate the loss of neurosensory retinal tissue in the right eye macula, most notably temporal to the fovea (blue arrow). The ellipsoid zone, which is the hyper-reflective line just anterior to the RPE, is in-tact. There is no sign of pseudo-drusen at the level of the RPE or vitreomacular traction in the pre-retinal space.\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_ophth_29_3.webp)"

          "explanation": "The OCT RNFL demonstrates a thin average RNFL thickness in the right eye (65µm) compared to the left eye (78µm). Using the RNFL thickness map and RNFL thickness plot, one can appreciate marked reduction in the thickness of the right nerve fibre layer, more so inferiorly than superiorly (purple arrows).\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_ophth_29_6.webp)"

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "D. Chronic BRAO",
          "explanation": "The patient presents with severe thinning of the temporal inner retina which corresponds to an attenuated inferotemporal retinal arteriole in the right eye.  He also presents with marked reduction of the inferotemporal RNFL thickness. Therefore, this patient most likely had an old branch retinal artery occlusion! As BRAOs are almost always secondary to thromboembolic events, a CT angiography from the aortic arch to the vertex should be ordered to rule out an embolic source. The patient’s family physician should also be engaged to help optimize any vascular risk factors."

  "description": "73M presenting with decreased vision OD for 3 years",
  "patientPresentation": "A 73-year-old man with no past medical or ocular history was referred to a neuro-ophthalmology clinic for decreased vision in his right eye. He noticed this decreased vision OD 3 years ago but denied any acute vision change or trauma. The vision was described as a “haze” that was worse in the superonasal quadrant OD. He denied GCA symptoms. He denied a painful red eye, flashes, floaters or visual field deficit.\n\nOn examination, visual acuity was 20/60 OD and 20/20 OS. There was no RAPD and intraocular pressure was normal. Extraocular motility and colour vision were normal. Anterior segment examination demonstrated symmetric 1+ nuclear sclerotic cataracts OU. Fundus photographs were taken and are shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_ophth_29_1.webp)\n\nFundus examination, as shown above, showed a normal optic nerve and macula OU. OCT macula imaging was then performed and is shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_ophth_29_2.webp)",
