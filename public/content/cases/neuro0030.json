          "explanation": "This visual field test demonstrates bilateral central scotomas. When viewing the grayscale map, the central scotoma is readily visible in both eyes. An early inferior arcuate defect is also present in the right eye, and this finding is reinforced by both the grayscale and pattern deviation maps. It is important to not view the grayscale map in isolation and to also consider the total and pattern deviation maps when interpreting visual fields."

          "explanation": "Fundus images demonstrate the presence of severe bilateral optic disc edema (ODE), as characterized by hyperemic discs, blurred margins, and engorged/tortuous veins. Her symptoms (i.e., blurred vision, migraine, pulsatile tinnitus) may be associated with raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Moreover, her history of obesity coupled with recent weight gain increase suspicion for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). However, alternative etiologies must be considered, and further investigations must be performed as IIH is a diagnosis of exclusion."

          "explanation": "Obesity is a significant risk factor for IIH, and weight reduction can lead to significant reductions in intracranial pressure (ICP), resulting in significant improvements in symptoms associated with IIH. Acetazolamide – a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor – may also be initiated in patients as this medication can lead to reductions in ICP by decreasing the production of cerebrospinal fluid."

          "explanation": "Smoking and ethambutol (medication to treat tuberculosis) have been associated as triggers for vision loss in the setting of LHON. However, some reports have also implicated elevated ICP and/or IIH as a LHON trigger. The exact mechanism has yet to be determined, but conversion to LHON remains a distinct possibility in individuals with a genetic predisposition for LHON.  The patient described in this case was initially diagnosed with IIH, but experienced a sustained deterioration in visual function which was secondary to LHON."
