          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "B. Right and left homonymous thinning OU",
          "explanation": "This GCA demonstrates homonymous thinning bilaterally. In other words, the pattern of thinning is highly similar in both maculae. \n\nGCA can be particularly useful in the evaluation of visual field defects, especially in the context of poor visual field testing. Lesions involving the retrochiasmal visual pathways (e.g., due to stroke) can result in retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and this is manifested in this patient by GCA thinning. The pattern of GCA thinning corresponds well to the visual field defect because the topographic organization of RGCs is maintained in the setting of retrograde degeneration."

          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "A. Atrial fibrillation",
          "explanation": "The presence of bilateral homonymous visual field defects indicates involvement of the retrochiasmal visual pathways on both sides of the brain. In the majority of cases, infarction of the visual pathways on both sides is due to a cardiac source. This may include atrial fibrillation or infections such as bacterial endocarditis. Other potential causes include demyelination that may involve the optic tracts on both sides."

  "patientPresentation": "A 76-year-old woman was referred for constant blurry vision in both eyes over the last 6 years. Her past medical history was significant for mild hypertension and joint inflammation. Her medications included prednisone 10 mg PO and vitamin supplementation. On examination, her visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/20 OS. IOP was 12 OU. There was no RAPD. IOP was 12 OU. Dilated fundus examination was performed and was unremarkable.\n\nHumphrey visual field testing (24-2) was performed and is shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/neuro_op_31_1.webp)",
