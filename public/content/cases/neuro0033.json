          "answerText": "D. Vitreopapillary Traction",
          "explanation": "As we age, the vitreous liquefies and contracts, exerting tractional forces on the retina and optic nerve head. The vitreous is most adherent at the optic nerve, and thus vitreopapillary traction is a phenomenon where the posterior hyaloid remains adherent to the optic nerve head, elevating it to produce a swollen disc appearance.1 OCT imaging allows for visualisation of the vitreopapillary interface as a hyper-reflective band adherent to the optic nerve (yellow arrows)\n\n![](/content/media/neuro5.webp)"

          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "D. No further testing required",
          "explanation": "It is important to keep vitreopapillary traction on the differential of patients with asymptomatic unilateral optic disc edema. As OCT imaging is non-invasive and non-ionizing, confirmation of vitreopapillary traction may save patients from unnecessary testing. However, some patients have reported blurriness, visual field defects, and/or gaze evoked amaurosis.2 In symptomatic patients, clinical correlation is required to decide on appropriate investigation course, as presence of vitreopapillary traction does not rule out the concurrence of a second underlying disorder."

  "title": "Case 33",
  "description": "67M referred for suspected optic neuropathy OS",
  "patientPresentation": "A 67-year-old man was referred to a tertiary neuro-ophthalmology clinic for suspected left optic neuropathy. He reported a 3-month history of blurred and distorted vision in his left eye, and a central scotoma that fluctuated when laying flat/bending forward. He denied pain, redness/photophobia, flashes/floaters, or peripheral field defects. Ocular history was significant for non-granulomatous anterior uveitis (work-up negative) and cystoid macular edema with an associated previous episode of optic nerve head edema, which was treated with topical corticosteroid drops 5 years prior.\n​\nVisual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/60 OS. There was a brisk left RAPD. The appearance of the nerve and visual fields are shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/neuro1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/neuro2.webp)",
