This patient fits the typical demographic profile, has normal visual acuity and visual fields, and demonstrates significant bilateral optic disc edema as seen in her fundus photos and elevated RNFL thicknesses."

          "explanation": "Papilledema (as shown in this case) is optic disc edema secondary to elevated intracranial pressure. IIH is one cause of papilledema; however, neuroimaging must be obtained to rule out potential space-occupying lesions. In the absence of intracranial masses, several indirect imaging signs such as transverse sinus stenosis, empty sella, flattening of the posterior globes, and optic nerve sheath distension may suggest intracranial hypertension with a high sensitivity and specificity (1,2). Lumbar puncture demonstrating an elevated opening pressure is required for a definitive diagnosis of IIH; however, in a well patient with normal visual function and otherwise no systemic symptoms, lumbar puncture may be deferred by some clinicians and the patient may be treated presumptively for IIH (3). Often, this requires close monitoring by a neuro-ophthalmologist familiar with following and treating IIH."

  "patientPresentation": "**Contributor**: Marko Tien, MD\n​\n​Patient Presentation: A 29-year-old woman was referred from her optometrist to a tertiary neuro-ophthalmology clinic for bilateral optic disc edema noticed on routine examination. She had been experiencing headaches, which had increased in intensity over the past few months prior to presentation. Otherwise, she was asymptomatic and had no visual complaints. She was not taking any medications and had no past ocular history. Her BMI was 40, but otherwise had no medical history.\n​\nVisual acuity was 20/20 OU, and there was no RAPD. The optic nerves are shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/neuro341.avif)",
