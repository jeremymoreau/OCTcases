Furthermore, the nasal RNFL in OD is not preserved; rather, it exhibits thickening (eliminating option A). Together, these findings are suggestive of asymmetric optic disc edema."

          "answerText": "D. Initiate high-dose oral prednisone for two weeks, followed by a rapid taper",
          "explanation": "The patient’s presentation is suggestive of BRAF/MEK inhibitor-associated papillitis. Bilateral papillitis secondary to BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy for metastatic melanoma has previously been described in a case report by Lim et al. (2016), in which the patient responded to pulsed corticosteroid therapy (1).\n\n​\n\nGiven the negative infectious workup in this case, empiric steroid therapy may be safely initiated. While the discontinuation of the BRAF/MEK inhibitors was appropriate, re-initiating these drugs has the potential to further compromise the patient’s visual prognosis. Moreover, in the absence of symptoms suggestive of raised intracranial pressure and with a normal MRI (without intracranial metastasis and optic nerve or leptomeningeal enhancement), lumbar puncture would have a low diagnostic yield. Similarly, fluorescein angiography to assess for disc leakage is unlikely to change the course of management.\n\n​\n\n​The patient was subsequently prescribed a two-week course of oral prednisone (60 mg/day), followed by a rapid taper. One month later, her visual acuity improved to 20/30 OU, with resolution of papillitis and normal visual field testing."

          "answerText": "D. All of the above",
          "explanation": "In a recent pharmacovigilance study by Huang et al. (2023), which examined adverse events reported to the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System, combination therapy with dabrafenib and trametinib demonstrated safety signals for uveitis (117 cases reported) and Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada disease (11 cases reported), along with other ocular complications affecting the anterior and posterior segment (2). Central serous chorioretinopathy has also been reported in this setting (2,3). While the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain poorly understood, it is hypothesized that BRAF/MEK inhibitors may have the potential to trigger an inflammatory response, potentially leading to disruption of the blood-retinal barrier (2)."

  "patientPresentation": "**Contributors**: Andrew Mihalache, MD(C) and Dr. Arun Sundaram, MD MSc FRCPC\n​\n\n\n​Patient Presentation: An 87-year-old female presented to a tertiary neuro-ophthalmology clinic following a referral for optic disc edema OU. The patient previously had a cutaneous melanoma excised from her left flank one year ago. Disease recurrence was identified in the left axillary lymph nodes, prompting the initiation of dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor).\n​\nFour months after starting BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy, she experienced progressively worsening, painless vision loss OD and transient blurred vision OS. Consequently, BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy was discontinued one week prior by the patient’s oncologist.\\\n​\nVisual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/30 OS. There was no RAPD. There were no cells in the anterior chamber or vitreous.\n​\n24-2 Humphrey Visual Field testing was performed and shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/neuro351.avif)",
