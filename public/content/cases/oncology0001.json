On OCT, optic nerve melanocytomas are characterized by hyper-reflectivity at its anterior tumor surface (red arrow) with dense posterior shadowing (blue arrow) with an optically empty appearance. Hyper-reflective foci (yellow arrows) are often seen within the tumor, which are characteristic of melanocytomas.\n\n**References:**\n\n1. Raval V, Reddy R, Kaliki S, Das T.

While vitreous seeds and adjacent retinal edema was noted in a small percentage of their cases, macular edema was not seen in any cases. Optic disc melanocytoma usually has a nodular appearance with a hyper-reflective anterior tumor border with optical shadowing of the posterior layers. Retinal disorganization is often noticed adjacent to or over the tumor.  \n\n **References:**\n\n1. Shields CL, Perez B, Benavides R, Materin MA, Shields JA.

  "patientPresentation": "A 53-year-old asymptomatic female was referred to the ocular oncology service to rule out melanocytoma in the left eye. No past medical or ocular history was noted. Review of systems was unremarkable. Vision was 20/20 OU with normal IOP and anterior segment examination. Fundus examination of the right eye was normal. Fundus examination of the left eye revealed the following:\n\n![](/content/media/oncology1-1_jpg_tif.webp)\n\n\\\nColour fundus: The optic nerve demonstrates a normal cup-to-disc ratio and colour. however, a raised dark-grey choroidal lesion over the temporal margin of the nerve is present, with a surrounding sub-retinal red lesion suggestive of hemorrhage.\n\n![](/content/media/oncology1-2.webp)\n\nFAF: Hypo-autofluorescent lesion temporal to optic disc corresponding to the lesion on the fundus photo (note: Subretinal hemorrhage attenuates lipofuscin signal from RPE) with a small area of hyper-autofluorescence in the superior aspect of the lesion, possibly attributed to denatured blood. \n\nYou pull up a fundus photo and FAF of known melanocytoma that you saw earlier in your training for reference, which is shown below. Note the more prominent encroachment of the feathery lesion into the optic nerve head, with no red hue around the melanocytoma.\n\n![](/content/media/oncology1-3_jpg_tif.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/oncology1-4_jpg_tif.webp)\n\nTo help further characterize the lesion and associated hemorrhage, an OCT of the optic nerve OS was conducted and shown below: \n\n![](/content/media/oncology1-5.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/oncology1-6.webp)",
