          "explanation": "![](/content/media/oncology2-4.webp)\n\nOne can appreciate the bright, hyper-reflective band (RPE) with a focal area of fluid underneath in the left image (red arrow) corresponding to a PED. This is in contrast to the other two larger areas of hyporeflectivity, which are sub-retinal fluid (blue arrows). This can be concluded as the fluid is over the hyper-reflective RPE. One can also appreciate a layering effect over the RPE in areas of subretinal fluid (green arrow), which you would not appreciate in PEDs.\n\nAnother key finding is thickened choroid (yellow arrow) under areas of irregular RPE contour with loss of vascular appearance."

One can appreciate a choroidal lesion with small height and irregular contour, along with hyper-echoic margin and hypo-echoic core adjacent to the optic nerve. The initial spike on A-Scan is broad with possible fluid in initial caliper setting. Calipers may be too anterior to first spike on A-Scan here. A pearl is to try to place the initial choroidal caliper on the surface of the choroid lesion.\n\n![](/content/media/oncology2-5.webp)\n\nBased on fundus photos, OCT of lesions, FAF and ultrasound images, what is the most likely diagnosis?",

          "explanation": "This patient was unfortunately diagnosed with Stage 4 lung adenocarcinoma with CNS metastases. You would expect a hyperechoic rim around an acoustically hollow dome shaped lesion if there is a melanocytic lesion on ultrasound, which is not appreciated in this patient. In addition, you would expect symptoms with a single lesion and thickness > 2mm if choroidal melanoma. Choroidal nevi are not associated with this degree of RPE disruption and subretinal fluid, along with multi-focal lesions. Following a CT chest, the primary tumour was located, leading to the diagnosis of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma.\n\nA review by Mathis et al. described the features of choroidal metastases, and described intra- and sub-retinal fluid, irregular contour, RPE disruption and choroidal localization as key factors in the diagnosis of choroidal metastases. \n\n**References:**\n\n1.

Decisions for treatment should be made with the prognosis and systemic status of the patient in mind, as well as with a discussion on the goals of care for the patient moving forward. \n\n**​Reference:**\n\n1.

  "patientPresentation": "A 63-year-old male was referred to a tertiary ophthalmology clinic for assessment of concerning retinal lesions OU. Past medical history was significant for a 10-pack year smoking history. Vision was 20/60 OD and 20/30 OS with no subjective changes over the last 6 months. Optos widefield fundus photos below demonstrated bilateral multifocal choroidal elevated lesions in the posterior pole, most noticeable in the peripapillary region of the right eye and primarily superior to the disc in the left eye. \n\n![](/content/media/oncology2-1.webp)\n\nFundus autofluorescence was conducted and shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/oncology2-2.webp)\n\nTwo areas of hyper-autofluorescence were appreciated: (1) Focal areas of hyper autofluorescence over the lesions (2) Wider and more diffuse hyper autofluorescence around the posterior pole which may be associated with fluid (active or chronic).",
