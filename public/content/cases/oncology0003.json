This undulation is secondary to the drusenoid PEDs (blue arrows), in keeping with the past ocular history of dry-ARMD. The right eye OCT macula demonstrates reduced retinal thickness compared to the left eye, possibly due to past history of primary open angle glaucoma (yellow bracket). There is no evidence of subretinal fluid."

The retinal layers are largely intact overlying an area of hyper-reflectivity in the intra-retinal or sub-retinal space (blue arrow). This could represent a large pigment epithelial detachment. Additionally, there is a crescent of hyper-reflectivity under the RPE at the apex of the lesion (red arrow) and homogenous hypo-reflectivity underneath (white arrow). While the retina is displaced anteriorly, there is no evidence of vitreomacular traction."

          "explanation": "Keeping in mind the hemorrhagic component of the lesion, the location (mid to far periphery) on fundus examination, the large PED on OCT, and the homogenous component of the lesion with low internal reflectivity on ultrasound, peripheral exudative hemorrhagic chorioretinopathy (PEHCR) is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nPEHCR is an uncommon degenerative process due to hemorrhage in the sub-retinal or choroidal region, often in the temporal quadrant. PEHCR is largely in older Caucasian females, with a mean age between 77 and 83. Hypertension and anti-coagulation therapy have both been demonstrated as risk factors for disease; however, very little is known about the pathogenesis of PEHCR relative to alternative choroidal masses. Clinical features include hemorrhagic or serous PEDs, sub- or intraretinal hemorrhage, lipid exudation and vitreous hemorrhage.\n\n* PEHCR is an older population with female predominance, association with hypertension, no familial relationship, temporal to the macula, 1/3 bilateral with no choroidal excavation on ultrasound.\n* Choroidal melanoma is a younger population with male predominance, no association with hypertension, familial relationship (BAP1 gene), macula location typically, 0.2% bilateral and choroidal excavation with acoustic hollowness on ultrasound​\n\n**References:**\n\n1.

  "patientPresentation": "An 88-year-old female was referred to the ocular oncology service to “rule out neoplasm.” The patient symptomatically noted decreased vision in her right eye for 1 month. Her past ocular history included retinal detachment repair OD 15 years ago, primary open angle glaucoma controlled with topical agents, and dry age-related macular degeneration changes for the past 2 years. Vision was 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS with normal IOP and pupillary examination. Optos widefield fundus photos are shown below. Notably, a laser scar was appreciated in the far temporal periphery OD, along with a suspicious, well-demarcated, dark, circular lesion in the mid-far periphery at 10 o’clock. \n\n![](/content/media/oncology3-1.webp)\n\nFundus autofluorescence OD and bilateral OCTs of the macula were conducted and shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/oncology3-2.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/oncology3-3.webp)",
