          "answerText": "D. All of the above",
          "explanation": "Ultrasonography is crucial in the diagnosis of choroidal tumours, as the acoustic nature of the lesion can help differentiate entities such as choroidal melanomas, metastasis, and hemangiomas. Optical coherence tomography is essential in characterizing the integrity of the outer retinal layers, retinal pigment epithelium, and features of the inner choroid. Fluorescein angiography is an important modality to characterize the staining pattern of lesions."

Observation can be implemented in asymptomatic cases that are not vision threatening. Photodynamic therapy and plaque and external beam radiotherapy have shown good results in indicated cases.\n\n**References**\n\n1. Madreperla SA.
