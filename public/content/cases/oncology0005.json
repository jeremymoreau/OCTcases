          "explanation": "The lesion does not demonstrate any orange pigment (a feature of choroidal melanoma) nor lacunae (feature of CHRPE), rather, demonstrates a yellowish flecks. The pigmented lesion is inferior to the macula along inferior vascular arcade and does not interact with the optic disc on fundus examination. With overlying retinal vessels clearly visualized, the lesion is in the choroid (note the retinal vessels which are well visualized coursing above the lesion). Yellow foci are noted at the posterior edge of the lesion, which are most likely lipid deposits."

          "explanation": "Putting together the lack of symptoms, presence of lipid exudates along the superior border of the lesion, choroidal location of the lesion, and lack of interaction with the optic disc, this patient most likely has a choroidal nevus. The pneumonic coined by Shields et al., “To Find Small Ocular Melanoma,” is useful in the diagnosis of choroidal nevus vs. melanoma. The pneumonic stands for “thickness > 2mm, subretinal fluid, symptoms, orange pigment, and lesion touching disc margin.” Drusen is a positive prognostic factor leaning towards choroidal nevus compared to a melanoma. The location of the lesion in the choroid is noted by the blue star. Hints to determine choroidal location are the choroidal vessels on either side of the lesion and loss of the choriocapillaris on OCT with shadowing within the choroid. ​\n\n![](/content/media/onc5-4.webp)"

          "explanation": "The OCTA segmented in the choriocapillaris nicely demonstrates a CNVM, which is noted on angioplex overlying the foveal avascular zone. This is a type 1 CNVM as it is located in the sub-RPE space. It is important to determine whether the presence of subretinal fluid in the setting of a choroidal nevus indicates a malignant transformation or the presence of CNV. \n\n​References:\nCallanan DG, Lewis ML, Byrne SF, Gass JDM.
