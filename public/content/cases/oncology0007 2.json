          "answerText": "B. Choroidal metastasis",
          "explanation": "Given the patient’s past medical history, the diagnosis is likely a choroidal metastasis. Choroidal metastases typically present as multiple, yellow-white choroidal lesions and may be associated with overlying subretinal fluid.\n\nChoroidal melanomas typically present as dome-shaped, brown-yellow pigmented choroidal lesions, associated with subretinal fluid and orange pigment.\n\nChoroidal nevi are well-circumscribed, typically flat variably pigmented choroidal lesions. They remain stable in size and over time, may be associated with overlying drusen as well as RPE atrophy, hyperplasia or fibrous metaplasia.\n\nThe mnemonic “To Find Small Ocular Melanoma Using Helpful Hints Daily” (TFSOM-UHHD) has been proposed to differentiate a choroidal melanoma from a nevus. The mnemonic suggests that a melanoma has a thickness >2 mm, subretinal fluid, symptoms (decreased vision, flashes or floaters), orange pigment, margin within 3 mm of the optic disc, ultrasonographic hollowness, absence of halo (band of depigmentation around pigmented lesion) and absence of drusen.\n\nChoroidal hemangiomas can be diffuse or well-circumscribed, orange-red elevated choroidal lesions, associated with subretinal fluid, orange plaques and RPE atrophy. A key diagnostic feature of choroidal hemangiomas is the patency of sub-RPE vasculature as there is no compression of the choriocapillaris. This contrasts with choroidal melanomas and nevi, which involve compression of the choriocapillaris.\n\nOn OCT imaging, a “lumpy bumpy” anterior tumor surface is characteristic of choroidal metastasis (Figure A2), with preservation of the inner retinal layers. Choroidal melanomas (Figure E), nevi (Figure D) and hemangiomas (Figure C) typically appear as gently sloping choroidal masses.\n\n![](/content/media/onc7_4.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/onc7_5.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/onc7_6.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/onc7_7.webp)\n\nImages from Mathis et al. 2019\n\nReferences:\n\nIuliano L, Scotti F, Gagliardi M, Bianchi I, Pierro L.

          "explanation": "All of these modalities can be used to provide local tumour control and improve visual function. Chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy are first line in the management of choroidal metastases. The choice of local therapy, especially radiotherapy, depends on the patient’s life expectancy, tumor location, size and number of metastatic foci. Conventional EBRT is the most common treatment for choroidal metastasis and is cost effective. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and anti-VEGF injections have also been reported as possible office-based treatments of choroidal metastasis.\n\nReferences:\n\nMathis T, Jardel P, Loria O, et al.

Her past ocular history was unremarkable. Her past medical history was significant for advanced breast cancer with known bone metastasis requiring chemotherapy. She denied pain or red eye, but she did note occasional flashes in the periphery over the last few days.\n\nOn examination, her best corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/400 OS. Her IOP was 12 mmHg OD and 15 mmHg OS. The anterior segment examination was normal, with no signs of inflammation. Fundus examination of the right eye was within normal limits. Fundus examination of the left eye revealed a hyperemic optic nerve swelling as well as an elevated non-pigmented choroidal lesion inferior to the optic nerve. The lesion is at least 10 DD in size with an extension to the macula and subfoveal area.\n\n![](/content/media/onc7_1.webp)\n\nThe accompanying OCT macula of the left eye shows the following:\n\n![](/content/media/onc7_2.webp)"
