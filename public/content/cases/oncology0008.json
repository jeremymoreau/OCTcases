          "explanation": "The main finding of the OCT images over the lesion are loss of delamination due to the lesion’s involvement of the entire neurosensory retina. The lesion has caused cleavage between the presumed inner limiting membrane and the ganglion cell layer (red arrows). There is also signs of vitreous seeding (green arrows). The hyporeflectivity on OCT demonstrates disorganization of the retinal layers, rather than intra- or subretinal fluid. There is a normal underlying choroid.\n\n![](/content/media/onc6.webp)"

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "Show Answer",
          "explanation": "Retinal metastasis is quite rare, contributing to less than 1% of intraocular metastasis. Therefore, a clinician should keep opportunistic infections leading to retinitis, inflammatory retinitis, and retinal occlusive disorders in their differential. These entities can also present with signs of retinal ischemia, exudation, hemorrhage, and detachment. Biopsy is crucial in the ultimate diagnosis and management for retinal metastasis."

  "description": "77F presenting with floaters OD for 1 week",
  "patientPresentation": "A 77-year-old woman presented to an emergency eye clinic with 1-week of right eye floaters. The patient denied trauma, flashes or a curtain over her vision; however, she did note her vision was not as “crisp” in her right eye during this time. She had a significant oncologic history including mucinous adenocarcinoma of the ovary, which was treated with debulking and adjuvant chemotherapy (carboplatin and taxol) 15 years prior and a mastectomy for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the left breast 5 years prior. Three months prior to presentation, the patient was found to have metastasis to her adrenal glands, bones and lung.  A lung biopsy was performed which found adenocarcinoma with mucinous features. However, there were some differences in immunohistochemistry between ovarian and lung markers. As the origin was presumed ovarian in nature, and the success of prior chemotherapy, the patient was re-started on carboplatin and taxol. Despite multiple cycles of chemotherapy, her metastatic lesions progressed on imaging.\n\n\nOn examination, her visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/25 OS. IOP was within normal limits and there was no RAPD. Anterior segment examination was within normal limits. Fundus photographs of the right eye were taken and are shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/onc1.webp)",
