The neurosensory retina on OCT, when correlated to the fundus photograph, seems to have a well demarcated mass (red arrows) with intraretinal disorganization; however, the retina nasal and temporal to the lesion has normal architecture. There is no subretinal fluid or hypo-reflective cavities suggestive of intraretinal fluid. PAMM typically presents as a hyper-reflective band within the inner retina."

          "explanation": "CHRRPE is a rare, benign tumour typically diagnosed in the pediatric population made of vascular tissue, glial cells and pigmented epithelial cells. Though the etiology is not yet known, a study by Pujari et al. surmised the lesion may arise from undifferentiated ectopic progenitor cells which failed to differentiate into RPE cells, ultimately accumulating within the retina. It is considered a hamartoma as this mature tissue is typically found within the retina and RPE, but grew in a disorganized manner. Clinically, CHRRPE is elevated with variable pigmentation and an overlying epiretinal membrane. They are typically found in the peripapillary region, but can also be found in the macula as in this case. There is a strong association with CHRRPE and NF2.\n\n*References:*\n\n1.

          "explanation": "The prognosis of CHRRPE has been demonstrated by Shields et al. in 2008 to be dependent on the location of the tumour. This study found that > 3 lines of Snellen visual acuity loss was seen in 60% of cases at 4 years with a macular CHRRPE, whereas only 13% had this level of acuity loss if presenting with an extra-macular tumour. The most crucial mainstay of treatment; however, is amblyopia treatment, as demonstrated by Schachat et al. in 1984. Regular monitoring every 6 months for potential complications, including epiretinal membrane progression, choroidal neovascularization, or macular holes should be conducted.\n\n*References:*\n\n1.

  "patientPresentation": "A 11-year-old male with a history of neurofibromatosis type 2 presented to a pediatric retina clinic for assessment of an atypical lesion in his posterior pole OD. The patient’s mother noted a painless decrease in vision over the last 2 years, but denied trauma, flashes, floaters or a visual field deficit. The patient’s NF2 was stable; his previous MRI brain and orbits was unremarkable. Best corrected distance visual acuity was 20/80 OD and 20/20 OS. IOP was within normal limits, and there was no RAPD.\n\nFundus photographs were taken and are shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/paed_1_1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/paed_1_2.webp)\n\nAn OCT macula of the right eye was also conducted and is shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/paed_1_3.webp)",
