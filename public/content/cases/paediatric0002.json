          "explanation": "![](/content/media/paed_2_3.webp)\n\nThere are several hyper-reflective round structures seen in the inner retina of the right eye (yellow arrows) that are creating a shadowing effect to the layers underneath. There is intraretinal fluid nasal to the fovea (red arrow) but not involving the fovea itself, which explains the patient’s preserved central vision.\n\nThere is no subretinal fluid, rather a shadowing effect from the hyper-reflective structures within the inner retina. If peripapillary folds were seen on OCT secondary to increased intracranial pressure, this would often be a bilateral finding, unless a focal tumor was creating a mass effect in one eye specifically. Regardless, an undulated pattern of the retina, RPE and Bruch’s membrane would be seen in that case."

          "answerText": "C. Wyburn-Mason Syndrome",
          "explanation": "Wyburn-Mason Syndrome (also known as racemose angioma) is a congenital neurocutaneous entity comprised of unilateral arteriovenous malformations (AVM) in the retina or other parts of the orbit or midbrain. The direct connection between arteries and veins leads to unregulated turbulent flow into the vessel causing wall damage and potential thrombosis and occlusion. A flame hemorrhage occurs when intraretinal vessels burst, accumulating blood in the retinal nerve fiber layer. The vessels seen on fundoscopy here are intact and quite prominent. Though described as a neurocutaneous entity, Wyburn-Mason Syndrome does not classically present with any skin manifestations.\n\nIn Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome, the classic finding is a vascularized tumor (retinal hemangioblastoma) that is fed by dilated, tortuous vessels. In Sturge-Weber Syndrome, ocular manifestations include a choroidal hemangioma, in which vessels are within the choroid and not as visibly apparent on fundoscopy as the AVMs seen here."

          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "B. MRI Brain",
          "explanation": "Retinal AVMs are often found in patients with Wyburn-Mason Syndrome; however, cerebral AVMs are also common in these patients and often asymptomatic. While retinal AVMs tend to be stable in Wyburn-Mason, the cranial AVMs can be quite friable and frequently bleed, leading to subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhages and causing death. MRI of the brain and orbits is crucial to rule out any intracranial AVMs.​\n\nManagement decisions are often complex, as surgical options for deep cerebral AVMs are challenging with risk of significant postoperative sequelae, and suprasellar intervention is frequently associated with vision loss. Close observation and optimization of risk factors is often the mainstay of treatment."

          "answerText": "D. Phakomatosis",
          "explanation": "Wyburn-Mason is considered a phakomatosis, or a neurocutaneous syndrome. This is a group of congenital disorders that involves central nervous system structures derived from the ectoderm, as well as skin manifestations. The exact etiology is unknown but is hypothesized to involve defects in embryology and inappropriate migration of vascular cells to their destination. It is considered a rare, non-hereditary, congenital disease with unilateral AVMs that affect the brain, eye, and facial structures, with occasional pigmented nevi or facial angiomas."
