          "answerText": "D. All of the above",
          "explanation": "The fundus photo above confirms the finding of bilateral optic disc elevation seen by the optometrist. The next step would be OCT imaging to help delineate the etiology for his elevation, whether it be optic nerve edema or causes of pseudo-edema. Remember, you can only call disc swelling “papilledema” if caused by elevated intracranial pressure.\n\nOCT imaging shows a homogenous, well-demarcated hyper-reflective ovoid mass-like structure (blue arrow). Peripapillary hyper-reflective ovoid mass-like structures (PHOMS) used to be an entity associated with optic disc drusen; however, a recent consortium of neuro-ophthalmologists have linked this finding to axoplasmic stasis and nerve fibre herniation from a number of pseudo-papilledema etiologies.\n\nOCT imaging also demonstrates hypo-reflective cavities (green arrow) at the optic nerve with a hyper-reflective border (red arrow). The key difference in drusen hypo-reflective cavities compared to shadowing from blood vessels are the surrounding hyper-reflective border and visualization of deeper structures.\n\n![](/content/media/paed_3_4.webp)\n\nReferences:\n\nFraser JA.

ODD is one of the most common causes of pseudo-papilledema.\n\n​"

The patient went to his optometrist for routine examination and a glasses update; he was asymptomatic with no headaches or visual changes. The patient denied past medical or ocular history. Best corrected distance visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/20-2 OS; IOP was 14 OD and 12 OS. There was no RAPD.
