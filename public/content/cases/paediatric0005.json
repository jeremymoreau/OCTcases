          "explanation": "Conventionally, neonates at risk of retinoblastoma are screened by clinical exam within the first week of life and postnatal genetic testing (cord or peripheral blood) for the familial RB1 mutation. However, the landmark study by Soliman et al. in 2016 found that prenatal molecular diagnosis with early-term delivery is associated with fewer and smaller tumors detected at birth, less invasive therapy, and better visual outcomes. Since a germline RB1 mutation predisposes the child to develop tumors in both eyes, delivery is recommended between 36-38 weeks’ gestation to enable early dilated retinal exam within the first 48 hours of life. Since tumor formation at a young age has a predilection for the posterior pole, early detection and treatment are important to optimize visual outcomes.\n\n​If no tumors are identified at birth, clinic exams are repeated frequently within the first 3 months of life, and then the infant is transitioned to exams under anesthesia (EUA). When a tumor is identified, treatment is performed under anesthesia and EUAs are repeated every 2-4 weeks until tumor control is achieved.\n\nReferences:\n\nSoliman SE, et al.

      "text": "The infant was examined in clinic shortly after birth, with retinal imaging (RetCam) and screening hand-held OCT (Bioptigen) of the posterior pole. No tumors were identified. Clinic exams with RetCam/OCT imaging were repeated frequently in the first month, then every 2 weeks until 3 months of age, with no evidence of tumors.\n\nA technique for OCT screening of the fovea, optic nerve and posterior pole quadrants was previously described. OCT is performed to assess for “invisible” (subclinical) tumors that are too small to be detected clinically.\n\nReferences:\n\nSoliman SE, et al. Optical coherence tomography-guided decisions in retinoblastoma management. Ophthalmology 2017;124:859-872.\n\nBerry JL, et al. Detection and intraretinal localization of an ‘invisible’ retinoblastoma using optical coherence tomography. Ocul Oncol Pathol 2016;2:148-152.\n\nAt 3 months of age, the child was seen for an EUA with RetCam and screening OCT. RetCam photographs (shown below) showed no sign of tumor in the right eye. Left eye examination found a suspicious lesion superonasally.\n\n![](/content/media/paed_5_1.webp)\n\nIn the right eye, the following OCT was acquired in the superonasal quadrant during the 3-month EUA:\n\n![](/content/media/paed_5_2.webp)\n\nIn the left eye, the following OCT scans were acquired during the 3-month EUA over, and adjacent to, the suspicious superonasal lesion.\n\n![](/content/media/paed_5_3.webp)\n\nWhat finding is appreciated on these OCT images?",

          "explanation": "Three small tumors were identified during the EUA (1 superonasal OD and 2 superonasal OS), two of which were not visible on fundus examination. The corresponding OCT images demonstrate a homogenous well-demarcated inner retinal mass with no associated subretinal fluid or SHRM (blue arrow).\n\n![](/content/media/paed_5_4.webp)\n\nAll three tumors were treated with focal laser (532-nm) during the EUA. Precise laser application to the invisible tumors was also guided by OCT.\n\nReferences:\n\nSoliman SE, et al.

  "patientPresentation": "A baby boy presented on the first day of life to a retinoblastoma clinic after his mother was induced at 36 weeks’ gestation. Since his father (proband) had a history of heritable retinoblastoma, the family was offered prenatal screening of the fetus for the father’s RB1 mutation by amniocentesis. Since the child was confirmed to carry the RB1 pathogenic variant, the family was offered early-term delivery at a high-risk pregnancy unit.",
