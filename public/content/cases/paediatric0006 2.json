          "explanation": "The fundus photos demonstrate a round/oval area of hypo-pigmentation (red arrow) at the fovea with an inner patch of retinal atrophy (green arrow). This corresponds to atrophy of the neurosensory retina at the fovea, as well as the underlying RPE (blue arrows). There are no hypo-reflective regions in the OCT suggestive of subretinal fluid or outer retinal tubulations. The left eye has full neurosensory retinal atrophy and an ILM drape at the fovea. The choroidal vessels are normal size.\n\n![](/content/media/paed_6_3.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/paed_6_4.webp)\n\n​\n\n## ​"

          "explanation": "Central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD) is a rare inherited retinal disease presenting with bilateral, well circumscribed macular lesions with atrophy of the neurosensory retina, RPE and choriocapillaris. CACD has four stages based on the amount of retinal atrophy and vision loss. Based on the presenting fundus changes and OCT, this patient is at stage 2-3 with an area of RPE atrophy within the area of hypopigmentation.\n\n​Do not confuse this presentation with best vitelliform dystrophy which has an “egg-yolk appearance.” Stargardt’s typically presents with a beaten-bronze macula and pisciform flecks, whereas North Carolina Macular Dystrophy presents with drusen, central atrophy and often subretinal fibrosis.\n\n​References:\n\n​Boon CJF, et al. Central areolar choroidal dystrophy. Ophthalmology 2009;116:771-782."

Approximately half of the cases do not have a confirmed genetic diagnosis. Through genetic testing, our patient was found to have an autosomal recessive mutation in PRPH2, with both parents being carriers."
