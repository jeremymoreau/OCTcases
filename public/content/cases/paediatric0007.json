          "answerText": "B. Ocular toxoplasmosis",
          "explanation": "Ocular toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of infectious retinochoroiditis in humans. This disease is due to infection by Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasite who’s obligate host is cats. Transmission is through fecal-oral route. Toxoplasmosis most commonly presents as necrotizing retinitis and vasculitis. The classic finding on exam is focal white retinitis with overlying inflammation, or a “headlight in the fog” with an adjacent pigmented retinochoroidal scar. Other ocular findings include iridocyclitis, vitreous inflammation, and ocular hypertension. Due to the high prevalence of toxoplasmosis infection in the population, a lack of IgG positive serology for T. gondii can rule out infection, but positive titers are not used for diagnosis. However, T. gondii PCR from aqueous or vitreous fluid has recently been demonstrated to have high sensitivity and specificity for disease.\n\n​\n\nReferences:\n\nKim SJ, Scott IU, Brown GC, et al.

          "answerText": "Show answer",
          "explanation": "Congenital toxoplasmosis infection can occur through transplacental transfer from mother to fetus, with clinical manifestations largely dependent on the age of the fetus during infection. This patient most likely does not have congenital toxoplasmosis, as congenital infection typically leads to neurological deficits and disability, as well as other ocular manifestations including microphthalmia, optic nerve atrophy and cataract. Toxoplasmosis is part of the “TORCH” congenital infections, which include syphilis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes viruses.\n\nReferences:\n\nSingh S.

  "patientPresentation": "A 12-year-old girl presented to a paediatric eye clinic with pain, redness, photophobia and decreased vision of the right eye. She denied trauma, recent travel, or sick contacts. She had no past ocular or medical history. She was on no medications. Visual acuity was 20/50 OD and 20/20 OS. There was no RAPD. IOP was 10 mmHg OD and 12 mmHg OS. Anterior segment exam revealed 1+ conjunctival injection with granulomatous keratic precipitates inferiorly, 4+ cells, focal posterior synechiae, a clear lens and 1+ vitreous cells in the right eye. The left eye anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Her optic nerves and macula were normal. Fundus photography was taken and is shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/paed_7_1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/paed_7_2.webp)\n\nA superonasal hyperpigmented chorioretinal scar with an adjacent white retinal lesion at the border was found in the right eye (not imaged). There was associated vitritis. The left eye also demonstrated a hyperpigmented chorioretinal scar superior to the optic nerve.\n\nA 5-line raster OCT was taken over the lesion in the left eye and is shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/paed_7_3.webp)",
