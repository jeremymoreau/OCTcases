          "explanation": "Presence of hypo-reflective (black) cavities in the intra-retinal and  subretinal space most prominently in the area nasal to the fovea and contiguous with the optic nerve. This likely corresponds to the  intra-retinal and subretinal fluid tracking from the optic disc. The subretinal fluid involves the foveal center and the retina appears  thickened nasally. Presence of intraretinal hyper-reflective particulates also visible.",

          "explanation": "Focal inflammation of the optic nerve head and peripapillary retina or macula is consistent with the diagnosis of neuroretinitis. The hyper-reflective material seen in the pre-retinal space likely represents vitritis, which can be commonly seen in neuroretinitis. There is a faint macular star seen in the fundus photograph, also seen in neuroretinits."

  "footer": "### Learning Objectives:\n\n1. Identify OCT features of neuroretinitis. OCT will demonstrate significant optic disc edema with contiguous spread to the macula, indicated by retinal thickening and intra-retinal and subretinal fluid. OCT rNFL and SD-OCT of the optic nerve will likewise demonstrate an increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer and peripapillary retina. \n2. Recognize Bartonella Henselae as the most common infectious etiology in neuro-retinitis."
