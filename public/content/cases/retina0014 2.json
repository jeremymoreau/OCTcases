This is in keeping with the blunted foveal reflex observed on physical examination of the patient.\n\n​​Additional abnormality: There is absence of the small elevation of the inner segment/outer segment junction at the fovea (red circle).\n\n![](/content/media/retina-14-2.webp)"

          "answerText": "B. Foveal hypoplasia",
          "explanation": "Normally, the foveal pit (or depression) develops as cells in the inner retinal layers are displaced by cells of the outer retinal layers such that the density of cones and rods increase in this region. During the 3rd trimester and early neonatal period, inner and outer segment layers lengthen, and the outer nuclear layer widens. Foveal hypoplasia occurs when there is a deficiency in this developmental process. Foveal hypoplasia may manifest with reduced VA and nystagmus."

          "explanation": "![](/content/media/retina-14-4.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina-14-3.webp)\n\nThe image above (from Thomas et al, 2017) depicts different grades of foveal hypoplasia and the OCT features present/absent in each. This is a tricky question. In the OCT images of the left and right eye, extrusion of plexiform layers and the foveal pit are absent (red arrows). OCT macula OD does not show outer segment lengthening (red circle) while OCT macula OS shows some outer segment lengthening. Outer nuclear layer widening is still present OU (yellow arrow/bracket). Therefore, the grading of foveal hypoplasia in the right and left eye are grade 3 and grade 2, respectively."

          "explanation": "Photodynamic therapy and intra-vitreal VEGF therapy is not indicated for foveal hypoplasia and will not improve the patient’s visual acuity as foveal hypoplasia is a congenital defect. Induced pluripotent stem cell therapy has not yet been approved as a treatment for common retinal diseases as studies of this treatment field are currently in the pre-clinical proof of concept and safety phases. The patient should be monitored and treated for common findings associated with foveal hypoplasia such as presenile cataracts (ex. Phaco-IOL) or aniridia (ex. possible iris prosthesis)."
