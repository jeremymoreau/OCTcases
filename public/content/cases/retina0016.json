          "explanation": "Imbruvica or ibrutinib is a small molecule drug used in the treatment of CLL. Many anti-cancer medications can have associated ocular toxicities, including cystoid macular edema (CME). Few common anti-cancer agents that have been reported to cause CME include inbrutinib, imatinib, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib.\n\nChlorpromazine is associated with abnormal pigmentation of the eyelids, cornea, anterior lens capsule, and rarely can cause a pigmentary retinopathy. It has not been reported to cause CME.\n\nReferences:\n\nSaenz-de-Viteri M, Cudrnak T. Bilateral cystoid macular edema in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with ibrutinib.

  "patientPresentation": "A 70-year-old male presented with blurry vision in both eyes for the past three weeks. He had a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), hypertension, schizophrenia, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and dyslipidemia. He was currently taking Imbruvica (medication for CLL), ramipril, chlorpromazine, tamsulosin, and rosuvastatin. On examination, visual acuity was 20/30 in both eyes. Slit lamp examination was normal. Fundus examination demonstrated abnormalities in the macula. An OCT macula was performed demonstrating the following:\n\n![](/content/media/retina-16-1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina-16-2.webp)",
