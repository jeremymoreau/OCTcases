It can be subtle and may not be evident on clinical examination. The exact etiology of thinning is not fully understood but thought to be secondary to ischemia and non-perfusion. The temporal macula is preferentially affected as it is a watershed zone (between the vascular arcades of the retinal circulation), and thus more susceptible to ischemia.\n\nReferences: ​Dell’Arti L, Barteselli G, Riva L, Carini E, Graziadei G, Benatti E, Invernizzi A, Cappellini MD, Viola F.
