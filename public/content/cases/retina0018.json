          "explanation": "![](/content/media/retina-18-3-.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina-18-4.webp)\n\nIn contrast to a full thickness macular hole (blue line), a pseudohole does not involve the full thickness of the retina. OCT also allows for differentiation of pseudoholes and lamellar holes, which are often confused for one another as they both lack a full-thickness retinal defect. There is no loss of retinal tissue in pseudoholes, and they have a vertical profile (as highlighted by the yellow line). On the other hand, lamellar holes usually have an anvil-shaped appearance (red line) with loss of inner retinal tissue but preservation of the outer retinal layers. We will discuss lamellar holes in more detail in another case."
