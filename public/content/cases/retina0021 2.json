The RPE and choroidal layers are not included on this OCT scan as the neuro-sensory retina is detached. Associated intraretinal fluid and presence of vitreous debris around the macula hole are also evident on OCT."

These are all features that are present in the OCT above, explaining the poor post-operative visual acuity of our patient.\n​\nReferences:\n\nSaber EE, Bayoumy AS, Elmohamady MN, Faramawi HM.
