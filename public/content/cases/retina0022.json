His past ocular history was unremarkable, and his past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes that is controlled by diet only. He is otherwise healthy. On exam, vision is 20/50 OD, and 20/20 OS. Pupils were equal and reactive, with no relative afferent pupillary defect and IOP was 15mmHg in both eyes. Slit lamp examination was normal. The fundus photo of the right eye is below:\n​\n\n![](/content/media/retina-22-1.webp)",

On OCT, it is frequently characterized by focal disruption in the outer retinal layers and hypo-reflective cavities in the inner retina with a characteristic draping of the ILM. The foveal contour is typically preserved."
