  "patientPresentation": "A 56-year-old male was referred to clinic for suspected diabetic macular edema. His past ocular history was unremarkable, and his past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes that is controlled by diet only. He is otherwise healthy. On exam, vision is 20/50 OD, and 20/20 OS. Pupils were equal and reactive, with no relative afferent pupillary defect and IOP was 15mmHg in both eyes. Slit lamp examination was normal.
