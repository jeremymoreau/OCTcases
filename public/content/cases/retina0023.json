The raster protocol consists of multiple line scans arranged in any plane (horizontal or vertical) and is useful to assess macular pathology at various levels. The raster protocol in this example utilizes horizontal segmentation, as highlighted by the red box."

We know the PPA will be seen on the OCT macula scan because the horizontal blue/green lines of the Raster protocol overlap this area in the LSO fundus photo (red boxes). When you look at the LSO fundus photo, you can see the characteristic ring-like whitish appearance of PPA around the optic nerve.\n\nOCT features of PPA include RPE and photoreceptor loss, RPE disruption, and inner/outer retinal thinning. The loss of RPE give the atrophic whitish appearance and increased light transmission.\n\nReferences:\n\nManjunath V, Shah H, Fujimoto JG, Duker JS.

          "explanation": "![](/content/media/retina-23-5.webp)\n\nThe curvature of the macula is bowed posteriorly (red line), which is often seen in a myopic eye with high axial length causing elongation of the globe. Instead of a round shaped globe, high myopic eyes are often oval shaped with or without an additional posterior bulging known as posterior staphyloma (not seen on this OCT).\n\nMany clinicians may consider this eye to have a posterior staphyloma based on this OCT. The steepened curve of the posterior sclera due to axial elongation does not confirm the diagnosis of posterior staphyloma, an outpouching of the wall of the posterior sclera. Features of posterior staphyloma include gradual thinning of the choroid from the periphery towards the edge of the staphyloma with gradual re-thickening of the choroid in the direction toward the posterior pole, and an inward protrusion of the sclera at the edge of the staphyloma. To make the diagnosis of a staphyloma on OCT, you will often require a wide field OCT to properly assess for these findings.\n\nReferences:\n\nTanaka N, Shinohara K, Yokoi T, Uramoto K, Takahashi H, Onishi Y, Horie S, Yoshida T, Ohno-Matsui K.
