An intra-retinal pseudocyst (hypo-reflective cavity) and trace extra-macula epi-retinal membrane are also noticed in the OCT.  The adherent posterior hyaloid is represented by the thickened hyper-reflective band anterior to the retina."

Disruption of the normal macular contour from the posterior hyaloid is consistent with VMT. The OCT on the right displays vitreomacular adhesion with preservation of the foveal contour despite the attached posterior hyaloid."
