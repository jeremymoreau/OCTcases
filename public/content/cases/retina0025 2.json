There are multiple confluent homogenous material under the RPE with RPE elevation consistent with drusen. Aggregation of confluent drusen has also caused drusenoid pigment epithelial detachment. Visual acuity can be predicted based on integrity of ellipsoid layer (red arrows). It is intact in this case, so we anticipate vision to be quite good for this patient."

PED occurs when RPE separates from Bruch’s membrane secondary to fibrovascular tissue, fluid, blood, or drusenoid accumulation. A serous PED occurs when fluid leaks into the space between the Bruch’s membrane and the RPE. It can occur in a variety of different chorio-retinal disorders including wet AMD and CSR."
