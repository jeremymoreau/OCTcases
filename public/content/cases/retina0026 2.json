          "explanation": "![](/content/media/retina-26-2.webp)\n\n**Diagnosis**: Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSCR)\n\nOCT is an excellent tool for diagnosing CSCR. Characteristic OCT findings of CSCR include serous detachment of the neurosensory retina (aka subretinal fluid), serous detachment of the RPE and/or thickened choroid (pachy-choroid) (red line). In this OCT, there is serous detachment of the neuro-sensory retina with no associated pigment epithelial detachment. While the choroid is visualized in this OCT, the level of detail is sub-optimal. To allow for better visualization of the choroid, SS-OCT or EDI-OCT are preferred."

          "explanation": "IVFA is a very useful tool in diagnosing and treating cases of CSCR. The most common IVFA pattern is an expansile dot that appears in early phases of the study and increases in size in late phases. Smoke-stack pattern is the most characteristic but only present in 10% of CSCR cases. It is characterized by a hyper-fluorescent dot that appears early in the study and spreads vertically as the study progress. This is thought to be due to convection currents within the sub-retinal fluid."

          "explanation": "About 80-90% of cases of CSCR resolves spontaneously within 3-4 months. Therefore, observation is reasonable as initial approach and treatment can be indicated in certain cases such as severe vision loss, status of the other eye if damaged by previous CSCR, recurrent disease, or patient occupation (eg. pilot). All treatment options listed above have been reported in the management of CSCR."

          "explanation": "![](/content/media/retina-26-3.webp)\n\nThe yellow arrows are pointing towards accumulation of waste products in the photoreceptor outer segment of the detached retina. This has traditionally been referred to as a “brush border pattern” and can be found in >70% OCT images in patients with CSCR. The separation of the neurosensory retina from the RPE prevents the photoreceptor waste products from being processed by the RPE. If the waste products persist, they may become permanent sub-retinal deposits after sub-retinal fluid re-absorption and lead to poorer visual outcomes.\n\nReference: https://www.intechopen.com/books/a-practical-guide-to-clinical-application-of-oct-in-ophthalmology/new-landmarks-signs-and-findings-in-optical-coherence-tomography"
