It is not due to any lipid deposition or thickened choroid. In fact, some studies have shown that patients with advanced stages of Stargardt disease have thinner choroids.\n\nReference: Vural E, Acar U, Sevinc MK, Erdurmus M, Kucuk B, Aykas S, Sobaci G.

Note that there are no breaks in Bruch’s membrane in this case, and as a result, no secondary CNVM."

          "explanation": "![](/content/media/retina-27-8.webp)\n\nA cardinal feature of SD on FA is the dark choroid sign. It occurs secondary to the widespread deposition of lipofuscin in the RPE, which blocks light transmission and occludes the underlying choroidal vasculature from view. The hyperfluorescent choriocapillaris can be seen in the areas of RPE atrophy due to the absence of RPE."
