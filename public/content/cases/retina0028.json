The disc appears swollen and the retinal veins are dilated and tortuous. There is an area of retinal whitening extending from the temporal optic disc into the macula. There is an area of hemorrhage along the superior arcades."

          "explanation": "As discussed in our “Background to OCT” section, the 3D macular map protocol is ideal for measuring retinal thickness (ILM – RPE thickness) as well as monitoring for change in thickness over time. Remember that the thickness ranges are color coded (200 - 300µm blue, 300 - 400µm green, red > 500µm). In this case, the area of retinal whitening has increased thickness, confirmed by the red on the thickness map (red box). These OCT features are in keeping with an acute retinal artery occlusion.\n\n![](/content/media/retina-28-7.webp)"
