Whether a certain material is hyper-reflective or hypo-reflective depends on its ability to block light.\n\n​Hyper-reflective on OCT (optically dense material, light blocking, less beam penetration): blood, drusen, cotton-wool spots, inflammatory cells, hard exudate.\n\n​Hypo-reflective on OCT (optically clear, greater light penetration): fluid (vitreous cavity, intra-retinal/sub-retinal fluid)."

          "explanation": "Myopic choroidal neovascular membrane (mCNV) is the second most common cause of CNV after AMD and occurs secondary to disruption of the integrity of the RPE/Bruch’s membrane complex. Upwards of 10 percent of eyes with degenerative myopia may develop CNV.\n\n​In a study performed by Introni et al., it was found that outer retina characteristics (i.e. hyper-reflective lesion with fuzzy borders and absent/altered ISOS junction) are useful parameters in evaluating myopic CNVM activity. While mCNVM can have associated with sub-retinal or intra-retinal fluid, they are typically scarce or absent.\n\nReference:\n\n1. https://www.aao.org/eyenet/article/diagnosis-treatment-of-cnv-in-myopic-macular-degen\n\n2.

She denied any recent ocular trauma.\n​\nOn examination, vision was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/60 in the left eye. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect and she had normal intraocular pressures. Slit lamp examination was normal. Dilated fundus examination demonstrated peri-papillary atrophy and tilted nerves in both eyes. An OCT macula was performed in both eyes, shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/retina-29-1.webp)",
