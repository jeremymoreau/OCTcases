The most notable abnormality is a well-defined hemorrhage in the macula. Given its well-defined appearance and the presence of overlying blood vessels, the hemorrhage is likely located in the sub-retinal or sub-RPE space. Within the hemorrhage, there appears to be a well-demarcated darker elevated area representing pigment epithelial detachment (green arrow) and an orange nodule suggestive of a polyp (red arrow)."

Correlating the line scanning ophthalmoscope (LSO) fundus photo with the optos photo, the hyper-reflectivity represents sub-retinal hemorrhage, while the well-demarcated darker area within the hemorrhage likely represents the PED (blue star). A notch sign (short yellow arrow) on OCT represent the organize polyp (green star) seen on fundus photo."

While PCV has traditionally been considered a sub-type of AMD, more recent evidence has identified differences in their clinical outcomes and response to therapy.\n\nReference: Cheung J.C.H., Ng D.S.C., Lai T.Y.Y.
