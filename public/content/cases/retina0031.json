          "answerText": "B. Hard exudate",
          "explanation": "This intra-retinal, hyperreflective lesion most likely represents a hard exudate. Drusen is usually located underneath the RPE and not within the retina. On the other hand, cotton wool spots are usually located within the nerve fiber layer as they represent focal infarction of the axons in this layer. CNVM is not typically associated with NPDR and is usually seen as a small hyperreflective growth emerging from the choroid into the retina."

          "answerText": "E. Both A and B",
          "explanation": "Hard exudates are mainly located in the outer plexiform and inner plexiform layers. Remember that hard exudates consist of lipid residue due to serous leakage from damage capillaries, and thus deposit in the areas where edema are typically located."

It is characterized by a hyper-reflective ring around an area of hypo-reflectivity. The black area underneath the hard exudate represents shadowing effect and not RPE loss."
