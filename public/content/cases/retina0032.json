          "explanation": "The yellow arrow is designating outer retinal tubulations.\n\n​Outer retinal tubulations (ORT) are degenerated photoreceptor outer segment arranged on OCT in a circular or tubular shape. These areas of atrophy are associated with a variety of chronic macular diseases and occurs in outer retinal layer degenerative processes. The take home message here is not to misinterpret these ORTs as intra-retinal fluid. ORT are characterized by hypo-reflective spaces surrounded with a ring of hyper-reflectivity located specifically in the outer nuclear layer. Recently, the hyper-reflective borders have histologically been characterized as external limiting membrane and photoreceptor mitochondria.\n\nReferences: Litts KM, Messinger JD, Dellatorre K, Yannuzzi LA, Freund KB, Curcio CA.

          "answerText": "C. Neovascular AMD",
          "explanation": "The incidence of outer retinal tubulations increases with time in patients with wet-AMD and other chronic macula diseases. One study, for example, found outer retinal tubulations in 7% of nAMD patients at 1 year of follow-up, whereas the incidence was 31% at year 3. Outer retinal tubulations are associated with worse visual acuity, larger area of atrophy and decreased contrast sensitivity in nAMD patients compared to eyes without outer retinal tubulations.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

          "explanation": "No treatment is required for patients with outer retinal tubulations as they remain stable over the course of time. Therefore, it is critical to differentiate these atrophic areas apart from intra-retinal fluid to minimize unnecessary treatment."
