Posterior bowing of the macula (green line)\n\n2. Thin choroid (red bracket)\n\n3. ILM detachment (white arrow)\n\n4. Dome shaped macula (convex anterior protrusion of the macula – yellow line)\n\nThese are OCT findings seen in highly myopic eyes.\n\n![](/content/media/retina-33-3.webp)",

          "explanation": "The images depict a good example of a posterior staphyloma. A posterior staphyloma is an outward protrusion of the posterior fundus and is most often seen in cases of pathological myopia. While identification of a posterior staphyloma is often achieved clinically by ophthalmoscopy, OCT (particularly wide-field imaging) can often be used to assess the staphyloma. In the OCT below (horizontal section), notice the sudden change in scleral curvature (red arrow) in the temporal macula, with posterior displacement of the sclera from the surrounding scleral curvature.\n\n![](/content/media/retina-33-5.webp)\n\nThe accompanying SLO image also provides good visualization of the posterior staphyloma. Notice the darker, circular outline (highlighted by the red circle) that is a result of the outward protrusion of the posterior wall. The yellow line is denoting the change in scleral curvature seen on the OCT with the dark outline in the SLO image, correlating the posterior outpouching between both images.\n\n![](/content/media/retina-33-6.webp)"

          "answerText": "D. Review the OCT images again",
          "explanation": "Development of unilateral metamorphopsia is very characteristic of macular pathology. If no obvious macular abnormalities can be seen on initial assessment on OCT, it is important to review the images again to ensure no subtle pathology is missed by going through the OCT raster scans. As discussed in our “Background to OCT section”, the raster protocol provides multiple line arrangements in any plane in high resolution and is one of the most essential tests used to assess the macula. However, a shortcoming of the raster protocol as you will see in this case is that it only provides information at the five cuts and will skip subtle pathology between each cross-sectional cuts and outside the area scanned (red box below).\n\n![](/content/media/retina-33-7.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina-33-8.webp)\n\nTo overcome this shortcoming, some OCT machines can also produce computerized 3-D images (bottom image) that allow clinicians to view the macula in more detail. The Cirrus-HD OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin Calif) has a macular cube protocol (shown below) that comprises of 200 horizontal lines scans. It allows the clinician to scroll through all these images for a more thorough overview of the macular anatomy compared to the raster protocol."

  "patientPresentation": "A 56-year-old male presented to the eye clinic with acute onset of metamorphopsia x 3 days in the left eye. His past ocular history is significant for myopia. He was seen 7 months prior in eye clinic and had a stable eye examination. On examination today, his vision was 20/200 in the left eye compared to 20/60 at his last eye examination 7 months prior. There was no RAPD. His slit lamp examination demonstrated mild nuclear sclerosis. Fundus examination demonstrated a myopic fundus with no obvious new changes in the macula.
