          "explanation": "Diagnosis: Outer retinoschisis secondary to vitreomacular traction and epiretinal membrane\n\nVitreomacular traction is a disorder of the vitreo-retinal interface where an abnormally strong adherence of the posterior hyaloid onto the macula leads to anterior traction and ultimately, morphological and functional deficits of the retina. This traction and adherence of the syneretic vitreous pulling on adherent sites of the retina is thought to be exacerbated by the epiretinal membrane, shown in number 1. The epiretinal membrane can add to the anterior traction and prevent spontaneous detachment of the vitreomacular adhesion. This adherence can lead to splitting of the outer retinal layer (number 2).\n\n![](/content/media/retina-34-2.webp)\n\nReferences:\n\nJohnson MW.

      "text": "Retinoschisis involving the macula can be difficult to differentiate from cystoid macular edema. On OCT, retinoschisis changes resemble intraretinal pseudo-cystic spaces exhibiting \"strand-like\" separations (or vertical pillars) as opposed to the oval or circular shaped intra-retinal fluid in CME. To definitively differentiate these two entities, an IVFA can be performed. There will be no leakage seen on IVFA in retinoschisis.\n\n![](/content/media/retina-34-4.webp)"
