          "explanation": "This OCT demonstrates subretinal fluid, similar to the OCT taken 6-months earlier. This patient is demonstrating persistent subretinal fluid following pneumatic retinopexy for retinal detachment repair. This has been shown in a 2001 publication by Desatnik et al. where 7 patients demonstrated delayed resolution of subretinal fluid after pneumatic retinopexy. This persistent fluid extended up to more than 2 years in some patients in the case series. Additional surgical procedures or laser photocoagulation did not affect the rate of subretinal fluid absorption, and spontaneous resolution of fluid eventually occurred in all cases.\n\nâ€‹A hint for chronicity of subretinal fluid (as seen in cases of CSR) is the brush border appearance (red arrows). The brush border pattern is due to waste products of the photoreceptors that can no longer be removed by the underlying RPE, causing elongation of photoreceptor outer segments and leaving a brush border pattern.\n\n![](/content/media/retina-35-5.webp)\n\nReferences: Desatnik H, Alhalel A, Treister G, Moisseiev J.
