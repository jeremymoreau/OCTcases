          "answerText": "A. Elevated choroidal mass",
          "explanation": "On OCT, you can see elevated choroidal lesions (blue circles) protruding anteriorly into the retina with shadowing effect posteriorly. Anterior protrusions of the retina caused by the choroidal lesions can be seen (yellow arrows). There are also hyper-reflective irregularities in the RPE with overlying attenuation/thinning of the ellipsoid and interdigitation zones (red arrows). Sometimes, subretinal fluid may also be present. As a general rule of thumb, presence of subretinal fluid in context of elevated choroidal lesion warrants urgent referral.\n\n![](/content/media/retina-36-3.webp)"

          "answerText": "D. Choroidal metastasis",
          "explanation": "Several features on OCT suggest a choroidal lesion of metastatic origin. The elevation of the choroidal lesion with overlying RPE irregularities and attenuation/thinning of the interdigitation zone and ellipsoid zone are ominous features. Other findings to watch out for include subretinal fluid and hemorrhage. The lobularity of the choroidal mass is also a key feature pointing towards a metastatic origin. On further history, this patient has a history of stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, making choroidal metastasis the likely diagnosis.\n\nReferences\n\nShields CL, Manalac J, Das C, Saktanasate J, Shields JA.

          "answerText": "E. Intraocular steroids",
          "explanation": "Systemic chemotherapy and immunotherapy are the preferred treatment modality for patients with choroidal metastases. Targeted immunotherapy allows for primary tumours and metastases to be treated simultaneously, with a minimal side effect profile. Prognosis in patients with choroidal metastases is still poor, even with treatment. Studies show that patients treated with external beam therapy, gamma knife radiosurgery, plaque therapy, photodynamic therapy, transpupillary therapy, and proton beam therapy have demonstrated tumour regression. Anti-VEGF intravitreal injections as a means of reducing the angiogenesis to reduce tumour dissemination has also demonstrated efficacy as an ocular treatment.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
