          "explanation": "When differentiating between a choroidal nevus and choroidal melanoma, follow the mnemonic ‘To Find Small Ocular Melanoma Using Helpful Hints’ (TFSOMUHH) proposed by Shields et al.: thickness (>2mm), fluid (subretinal), symptoms (floaters, flashes), orange pigmentation, margin (< 3mm of disc), ultrasonographic hollowness and halo (absence). Drusen overlying choroidal nevi is not uncommon. Because the lesion thickness appears to be <2mm, no subretinal fluid is detected, the patient is asymptomatic, lesion margins are >3mm from the disc, and an orange pigmentation is not seen on fundoscopy, the lesion is likely benign."

          "explanation": "Choroidal nevi can exhibit different patterns on OCT.  In this case, the choroidal nevus has a hyper-reflective anterior border (yellow box) with thinning of the choriocapillaris. It is hypothesized that the hyper-reflectivity is secondary to the orientation of nevus cells and effacement of the overlying choriocapillaris. While this may occur around the entire nevus, the anterior cells cast a dark shadow (red arrow) that obscures this effect below. Also note that the overlying retina and Bruch’s membrane appears preserved in our case. There is no sub-retinal fluid and drusen seen on OCT.  \n\n![](/content/media/retina-37-4.webp)\n\nTo properly evaluate a choroidal nevus on OCT, it is best to utilise enhanced depth imaging (EDI) OCT, which can allow for precise measurement of tumor thickness.

          "explanation": "Depending on size and clinical suspicion of choroidal nevus, fundus photography, OCT and A/Bscan to measure for elevation may be performed. Large base diameter >4-5mm or those close to posterior pole may warrant frequent follow up at 6month initially to ensure no progression. A study by Shields et al. analyzed 2514 cases of choroidal nevi. Transformation into melanoma occurred in 2%, 9%, 13% of nevi within 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Therefore it is recommended to perform routine fundus examination and OCT imaging in these patients. Intravitreal anti-VEGF and intraocular corticosteroids are not recommended as a treatment for choroidal nevus.\n\nReferences\n\nShields CL, Furuta M, Berman EL, et al.
