          "explanation": "Torpedo maculopathy is a congenital condition characterized by hypo-pigmentated torpedo-shaped (or oval shaped) lesion that is typically found temporal to the macula. Torpedo maculopathy is a non-progressive lesion and individuals are usually asymptomatic, unless the lesion affects the fovea. On OCT, disruption of the interdigitation zone, ellipsoid zone, and RPE can be detected. Choroidal excavation is often associated OCT finding."

          "answerText": "Show answer",
          "explanation": "Type 1 torpedo maculopathy is characterized by normal findings of the inner retina, and attenuation of the interdigitation zone, ellipsoid zone, and RPE. Type 2 torpedo maculopathy is characterized by normal findings of the inner retina, and attenuation of the interdigitation zone, ellipsoid zone, and RPE, as well as choroidal cavitation. In the OCT above, choroidal excavation was present therefore this patient has type 2 torpedo maculopathy. Type 3 torpedo maculopathy, which is a variant of type 2 with inner retinal involvement and no subretinal cleft, has been proposed by Tripathy et al. in 2018.\n\nReferences\n\nTripathy K, Sarma B, Mazumdar S.

          "explanation": "Torpedo maculopathy is a non-progressive, typically asymptomatic, congenital lesion. Potential complications include choroidal neovascularization, retinal detachment and RPE degeneration. General recommendation is to monitor patients annually/semi-annually using multi-modal imaging (visual field, OCT, fundus photography, and macular threshold perimetry)."
