          "explanation": "On each OCT image, the foveal pit or depression is blunted and elevated (blue arrows).  Pyramid-shaped hyper-reflective material is present in the sub-retinal space corresponding to the egg yolk-like macular lesions in the fundus photographs. The external limiting membrane and ellipsoid zone are intact and contiguous (red arrows).\n\nWhile the pyramid-shaped hyper-reflective material may at first appear as a pigment epithelial detachment (PED), there is no PED in this OCT because the RPE (green arrow) is not elevated. This is where anatomy comes into play - know your layers well and you will be able to identify the area of pathology more precisely.\n\n![](/content/media/retina-42-5.webp)"

          "explanation": "Best Vitelliform Macular Dystrophy (BVMD) is a genetic maculopathy caused by a mutation in the BEST1 gene that codes for the bestrophin protein. Bestrophin is a transmembrane chloride channel found on the RPE. Mutations to this protein results in accumulation of lipofuscin material in the outer retinal layers, which can be appreciated on OCT as demonstrated above. BVMD demonstrates both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive patterns. This patient is an example of autosomal recessive BVMD (see genetic testing results below).\n\n![](/content/media/retina-42-7.webp)"

Other stages of the disease have different clinical appearances with correspondingly different features on OCT. For more details on this, please refer to the following article:"

          "explanation": "Treatment of BVMD is related to the complication sequela associated with the disease. Choroidal neovascular membrane (CMVM) formation can occur in patients with BVMD. CNVM may result in subretinal hemorrhage and macular edema, which can cause subsequent visual impairment. Treatment of CNVM includes intravitreal anti-VEGF and photodynamic therapy. This patient does not have a CNVM and visual acuity is stable so anti-VEGF therapy is not likely not to be of benefit. Regular eye examinations to monitor for progressions is recommended. Genetic counselling for family members is also advised."
