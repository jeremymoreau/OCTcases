          "answerText": "A. Hypotony maculopathy",
          "explanation": "Hypotony maculopathy is characterized by low intraocular pressure with associated fundus abnormalities including chorio-retinal folds and disc edema. Low intraocular pressure can be defined statistically (< 6.5 mmHg) or clinically (low IOP resulting in vision loss). Hypotony and hypotony maculopathy may occur after surgery (especially filtration procedures), ocular trauma, or chronic inflammatory processes (ex. uveitis). It is strongly recommended to check for bleb and wound leakage for Seidel (positive leak) and measure IOP during regular post-op appointments following filtration surgery. OCT imaging can be done to confirm hypotony maculopathy in cases where subtle chorio-retinal folding may be difficult to assess on fundus examination."

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "D. Over-filtrating bleb",
          "explanation": "Generally, hypotony following filtration surgery is caused by either a bleb leak or an over-filtrating bleb. This patient’s filtering-bleb appeared elevated and diffuse with Seidel negative, suggesting that too much fluid is being filtered through. A bleb leak may be suspected if a patient is Seidel positive with a shallow bleb and warrants urgent treatment to prevent infection."
