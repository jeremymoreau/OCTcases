          "answerText": "Show answer",
          "explanation": "The diagnosis is **peripapillary choroidal neovascular membrane.**\n\nPeripapillary CNVMs are collections of new blood vessels originating from the choroid within one disc diameter from the optic nerve head that infiltrate into the retina resulting in bleeding in either the intra-retinal or subretinal space. Clinical manifestations of this disease occur when these choroidal blood vessels infiltrate into the retina. Anti-VEGF injections remain the hallmark treatment for this condition if macula is involved or threatened, leading to significantly improved visual acuity and improved anatomical retinal structures at the 12-month mark."
