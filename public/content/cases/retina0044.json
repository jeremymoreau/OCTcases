          "explanation": "The OCT macula demonstrated sub-foveal, focal choroidal excavation (FCE), as demonstrated by the white arrow. FCE presents clinically as subtle RPE changes on dilated fundus examination, but on macula OCT, demonstrates posterior bowing of the RPE and Bruch’s membrane complex. The outer retinal layers can fall back through the RPE (conforming FCE), as demonstrated in this image, or remain in normal position with presence of subretinal fluid (non-conforming FCE).\n\n![](/content/media/retina-44-2.webp)\n\nReference\n\nLee CS, Woo SJ, Kim YK, Hwang DJ, Kang HM, Kim H, Lee SC.

          "explanation": "First postulated in 2017 by Chung et al., FCE has been linked to pachychoroid spectrum of disease. Pachychoroid phenotype is characterized as increased choroidal thickness, dilated choroidal vessels, and breakdown of the choriocapillaris. It appears through recent literature that FCE is a manifestation of pachychoroid spectrum of disease. It is postulated that large choroidal vessels can compress the choriocapillaris, ultimately leading to ischemia and atrophy of the inner choroid and retinal pigment epithelium layer (causing FCE). \n\nReference\n\nChung, H, Byeon SH, Freund, BK.

          "explanation": "The flow B-scan demonstrates new blood flow at the level of the RPE within the choroidal excavation, and when correlated to the ORCC segment of the OCTA, most likely demonstrates a new CNVM. Choroidal neovascularization has been shown to be a complication of conforming FCE, but it also may be a cause of the FCE as part of the pachychoroid spectrum. Due to the temporal aspect of this patient presentation, it can be concluded that the FCE led to CNVM, causing vision loss. The image below shows the initial OCTA flow B-scan on initial presentation (left) and the 3-week OCTA on the right, demonstrating serial progression of blood flow on flow B-scan images.\n\n![](/content/media/retina-44-5.webp)"
