Therefore, asking the technician to localize the 5-line raster over the peripapillary area would be crucial to provide further information of the disease process and to rule out optic nerve related disease processes.\n\nReferences: \n\nHong SW, Ahn MD, Kang SH, Im SK.

          "explanation": "Peripapillary pachychoroid syndrome (PPS) is a variant of the pachychoroid disease spectrum which presents with localized intra-retinal and/or subretinal fluid primarily in the peripapillary region. These patients typically have thicker nasal macular choroids with enlarged Haller’s vessels, in keeping with pachychoroid disease. The landmark study introducing PPS in 2018 also demonstrated associations to discs at risk, choroidal folds, hyperopes, and peripapillary pigmentary mottling without focal leakage on fundus autofluorescence. This disease is not related to the pathophysiology of diabetic macular edema.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Phasukkijwatana N, Freund KB, Dolz-Marco R, et al. Peripapillary pachychoroid syndrome.

          "explanation": "A study by Xu et al. in 2020 investigated the treatment outcomes of patients with PPS managed with laser, anti-VEGF injections or observation. This study concluded that there was no significant difference in visual outcomes for patients managed conservatively versus those managed medically. Therefore, saving patients from un-necessary treatment by effectively diagnosing PPS, rather than DME, is crucial.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Xu D, Garg E, Sakurada Y.

  "patientPresentation": "An 80-year-old male was referred to a tertiary retina clinic for assessment of bilateral persistent intraretinal fluid. Patient failed topical treatment for CME and repeated intravitreal anti-VEGF. Past medical history includes T2DM, hypertension, dyslipidemia and coronary artery disease.\n\nVision was 20/40 OD and 20/30 OS with no RAPD and IOP within normal limits. Slit lamp examination was unremarkable. Dilated fundus examination demonstrated stable intraretinal fluid temporal to the optic disc respecting the macula OU, as well as scattered hard exudates at the macula. Optos wide field fundus photos and OCT maculas are shown below.\n\n![](/content/media/retina45_1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina45_2.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina45_3.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina45_4.webp)",
