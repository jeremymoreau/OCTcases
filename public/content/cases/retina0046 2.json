          "explanation": "The OCT demonstrates a growth in the sclera pushing anteriorly into the choroid causing elevation of the overlying neurosensory retina. The RPE is attenuated, most likely due to the compression of the choroid leaving poor perfusion of the RPE cells."

          "answerText": "B. Sclerochoroidal calcification",
          "explanation": "This patient most likely presented with sclerochoroidal calcification. This disease process usually manifests in asymptomatic females in the midperipheral fundus due to stable deposition of calcium into the sclera. Due to the primarily scleral-based disease as demonstrated on OCT, this is unlikely a choroidal osteoma. Sclerochoroidal calcifications have been classified by “mountain-like” topographic patterns seen on EDI-OCT, with larger deposits causing more compression of the overlying RPE, EZ and ELM layers. Be careful as these calcifications can be mistaken for infiltrative or metastatic processes. Identifying the scleral indentation on OCT is crucial.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

          "explanation": "Unlike choroidal osteoma, sclerochoroidal calcification is a stable deposition of calcium that has minimal risk for vision loss. In a retrospective chart review of 179 patients with sclerochoroidal calcification, no lesions demonstrated enlargement, related subretinal fluid/hemorrhage, choroidal neovascularization or vision loss during 4 years of follow-up. Focal choroidal atrophy and RPE atrophy were the only findings found in the largest sclerochoroidal calcification case, with no other complications appreciated. No treatments are required for these patients.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Shields CL, Hasanreisoglu M, Saktanasate J, Shields PW, Seibel I, Shields JA.

  "patientPresentation": "A 69-year-old Caucasian female with a past medical history of breast cancer was referred to a tertiary retina clinic for assessment of a suspicious retinal lesion in the right eye found by her optometrist on routine examination. The patient was asymptomatic with no past ocular history. Vision was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS with no RAPD and IOP within normal limits. Dilated fundus examination demonstrated a discrete, yellow lesion in the superior mid periphery over the superior arcade.
