Hyper-reflective foci suggestive of exudates, blood or vessels were appreciated at the level of sub-RPE in the sub-foveal region (yellow arrow). This caused antero-posterior mechanical elevation of the overlying neurosensory retina.\n\n![](/content/media/retina47_5_jpg.webp)"

          "explanation": "The findings of RPE and ellipsoid zone disruption, along with hyper-reflectivity at the sub-RPE level lead to a broad differential. However, a key finding in the pachychoroid disease spectrum (PDS) is the enlarged pachyvessels of the Hallerâ€™s layer in the choroid. PDS was initially described in 2013 by Warrow et al. as a constellation of pathological states characterized by a thickened choroid. However, we now believe, through the advent of improved multimodal imaging, that PDS is a spectrum of diseases causing a range of exudation, neovascularization and/or atrophy of the retina due to enlarged or engorged choroidal vessels.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

          "answerText": "B. Pachychoroid neovasculopathy",
          "explanation": "Pachychoroid neovasculopathy (PNV) is a neovascular entity of PDS which typically presents with reduced fundus tessellation, type 1 CNV, RPE disruption overlying enlarged pachyvessels and obliterated choriocapillaris. The OCTA helped diagnose neovascularization with a prominent choroidal vessel growing in the outer retina on segmentation and the corresponding flow B-scan demonstrating blood flow in the hyper-reflective area of interest (green arrow).\n\nOne can differentiate PNV from the alternate PDS entity with neovascularization, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) as PCV typically presents with neurosensory retina detachments and serous or hemorrhagic pigment epithelial detachments on OCT, as well as aneurysmal or polypoidal lesions on OCTA. \n\nFocal choroidal excavation typically has focal loss of RPE with conforming retinal layers in the area of deficit with no CNV, whereas pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy is the PDS entity which presents with diffuse atrophy of outer retinal layers, both of which are not seen in this patient. \n\n![](/content/media/retina47_7.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina47_8.webp)"

          "explanation": "A study by Cho et al. in 2019 investigated the treatment outcomes of patients with PNV compared to those with neovascular AMD. The results concluded that anti-VEGF treatment for PNV showed similar efficacy to treatment outcomes in patients with nAMD. In addition, patients diagnosed with PNV have less need for injections during maintenance phase. Therefore, accurate diagnosis is crucial for reducing the number of intravitreal injections for patients.  \n\nReferences:\n\nCho HJ, et al.

  "patientPresentation": "A 55-year-old male was referred to a tertiary retina clinic by his optometrist for suspicion of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) OS. The patient denied any acute change in vision or family history of AMD. Past medical history included hypothyroidism managed with levothyroxine. \nVision was 20/20 OU with no RAPD and IOP within normal limits. Slit lamp examination was unremarkable. Near-infrared reflectance imaging was conducted which demonstrated hyper-reflective foci at the macula surrounding a circular focal area of hypo-reflectance at the fovea OS. Multi-color SLO imaging was conducted which demonstrated multiple red foci surrounding the fovea OS suggestive of depigmentation. Right eye imaging was unremarkable. \n\n![](/content/media/retina47_1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina47_2.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina47_3.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina47_4.webp)",
