The external limiting membrane can be seen just inner to the ellipsoid zone and appears intact. There appears to be hyper-transmission just under the affected area which could also indicate RPE damage."

This shows as a focal area of hypo-autofluorescence on fundus autofluorescence and a window defect due to hyper-transmission through the damaged retinal pigmented epithelium on fluorescein angiography."

          "explanation": "Unfortunately, no treatment has shown proven benefit for the treatment of solar retinopathy. Spontaneous recovery may occur within the first few months after the event, however central/paracentral scotomas and metamorphopsia may become permanent. If the defect is unilateral, some patients may be asymptomatic at presentation and solar retinopathy may present as an incidental finding and an OCT diagnosis. Most cases, however, are bilateral."

  "patientPresentation": "**Contributors:** Miguel Cruz Pimentel MD, Parsa Mehraban Far, Peng Yan MD FRCSC\n\nA 54-year-old man with an unremarkable past ocular history presented with visual distortions in his right eye. He described the visual distortions as bothersome but disclosed that they have been present in that eye for most of his life. Visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/20 OS. Fundus examination was within normal limits and OCT macula was obtained, shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/retina_48_1.webp)",
  "footer": "### Learning Objectives:\n\n1. Recognize solar retinopathy as a differential diagnosis for focal disruption of the ellipsoid zone/RPE.\n\n2. Laser pointer injury should also be included in the differential diagnosis of focal ellipsoid zone/RPE disruption.\n\n3. Patient education and use of protective gear for sungazing is the most effective preventative strategy to reduce further vision loss."
