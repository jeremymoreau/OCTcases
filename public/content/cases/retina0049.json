          "explanation": "Given the presence of the worm on fundus examination and history of previous raccoon exposure, the patient has diffuse unilateral subacute neuroretinitis (DUSN). DUSN is an ocular parasitic infection. It is caused by a nematode that triggers an inflammatory and degenerative process in the retina and RPE. In its acute stage, vision loss is often related to vitritis and optic disc edema. Evanescent multifocal gray-white lesions at the level of the outer retina can also be visualized. If it progresses into the chronic stage, focal or diffuse degenerative changes in the RPE and retina, vascular narrowing and progressive ganglion cell loss leading to optic nerve atrophy may be seen. ​\n\nWith unilateral retinitis pigmentosa, we observe the classic triad involving arteriolar attenuation, retinal pigmentary changes (either hypopigmentation and/or hyperpigmentation in form of bone-spicule and pigment clumping), and waxy pallor of the optic disc. With toxoplasmosis, we would observe a fluffy, white or yellowish fundus lesion with overlying vitreous cells. These lesions initiate within the inner layers of the retina. With MEWDS, we would observe flat, multifocal, grey-white lesions appearing at the level of the RPE."

          "answerText": "A. Inner retina",
          "explanation": "The worm is located within the inner retina (white arrow). The hyperreflectivity seen within the middle and outer retina is related to the application of thermal laser. Typically, retinal nematodes are found in the subretinal space, so this is a somewhat atypical location of the nematode. Other OCT findings include an increased internal limiting membrane reflex (Orefice’s sign) and diffuse degenerative changes in the RPE. Subretinal tunnels may also be appreciated on OCT, suggestive of remnants of larva migration in the subretinal space (Garcia’s signs).  \n\n![](/content/media/retina49_4.webp)\n\nReferences:\n\n(1) Mazzeo, T., Dos Santos Motta, M.

          "answerText": "E. A and/or B",
          "explanation": "Management of DUSN typically involves laser photocoagulation or systemic anti-helminthics (like albendazole). If the worm can be visualized, it should be treated with laser photocoagulation. When clinical features are present in the absence of a visible worm, pharmacologic treatment with anti-helminthics like albendazole should be initiated. Photocoagulation is preferred as the elimination of the nematode halts vision loss and results in regression of inflammation. Anti-helminthic therapy can be useful when the worm can not be found, or when laser therapy is not appropriate as the worm is located near the disc or the fovea. Oral corticosteroids may help decrease the inflammatory response, but intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide is not used. Anti-VEGF injections are not used as there is no sub-retinal neovascularization."
