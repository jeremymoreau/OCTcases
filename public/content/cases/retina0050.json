          "answerText": "A. 1: Intraretinal fluid, 2: Hard exudates, 3: blood",
          "explanation": "Fluid within the retina presents is hypo-reflective (dark) on OCT. Blood, fibrosis, exudates, and infiltrates are hyper-reflective on OCT. Here, the large dark circles beneath within the retina are intraretinal fluid. The small hyper-reflective objects are hard exudates, composed of lipid and proteinaceous material, which typically reside in the upper retinal layers. The large hyper-reflective area in the right eye is free blood in the retina, which creates a hypo-reflective shadow on more posterior layers of the retina behind it.\n\n![](/content/media/retina50-3.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina50-4.webp)"

          "answerText": "B. Diabetic macular edema",
          "explanation": "The diagnosis is diabetic macular edema. OCT findings associated with diabetic macular edema include retinal swelling, macular edema, and hard exudates.\nElevated HbA1c indicates poorly controlled diabetes, which leads to vascular changes and the proliferation of blood vessels in the retina which causes macular edema."
