          "explanation": "On the OCT image, the foveal pit is disrupted and appears to take the shape of an ‘omega sign’ (blue arrows). Hyper-reflective material is present above the RNFL, representing an epiretinal membrane (yellow arrows). The continuity of the RPE and Ellipsoid zone is disrupted – both layers demonstrate a uniform depression and are hypo-attenuated (green circle). Inner-retinal splitting is noted with the yellow arrow. The inner retinal layers are absent above the fovea (red brackets), however the outer retinal layers are preserved. There is no intra-retinal cyst. \n\n![](/content/media/retina52-2.webp)"

          "answerText": "C. Lamellar macular hole (LMH)",
          "explanation": "VMT syndrome, LMH, MPH, FTMH may appear similar on OCT and may occur across a spectrum of disease progression.\n\nVMT syndrome occurs in the setting of an incomplete posterior vitreous detachment where the posterior hyaloid face pulls away from the macula at different rates. This is not seen on the patient’s OCT. VMT may progress to a LMH or even a FTMH.\n\nBoth MPHs and LMHs lack a full thickness retinal defect, whereas FMTH results in a loss of all retinal layers. In MPH, retinal tissue is preserved and the defect is typically vertical. In LMH, the inner retinal layers are absent however the outer retinal layers are preserved. LMHs result from an aborted process of formation of FTMH, whereas MPH occur from traction due to ERM. On OCT, LMHs often have an ‘anvil-shaped appearance’ (yellow lines) because of loss of inner retinal layers (red box) with preservation of the outer retinal layers (blue box).\n\nIf you’d like more practice on differentiating between these entities, check out Retina Case 18!\n\n![](/content/media/retina52-3.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina52-4.webp)"

          "explanation": "The diagnostic criteria for a lamellar macular hole has previously been defined by Wikin et al (1) and includes the following: (1) irregular foveal contour (blue arrows), (2) break in inner fovea (red circle), (3) intraretinal splitting (yellow brackets) and (4) absence of full thickness foveal defect with intact foveal photoreceptors (green brackets). These features were previously identified in question 1.\n\nIntraretinal cysts and ERM are commonly seen in patients with lamellar macular holes, however, they are not included in the diagnostic criteria. \n\nReferences:\n\n1.

          "explanation": "Management of LMH depends on the stability of disease and visual function. LMHs are often monitored with serial visual assessment (including VA and fundus examination), OCT macula, and fundus photography. However, acute visual decline in the setting of progression of a LMH often necessitates surgical intervention. These patients may undergo PPV with an ERM peel (if present); studies have also showed greater visual acuity improvement with the inclusion of phaco-IOL in addition to PPV.\n\nIt may be reasonable to monitor this patient with routine visual assessment (including VA and fundus examination), OCT macula, and fundus photography. If visual acuity continues to decline, they may be a candidate for surgical intervention.  \n\nReferences:\n\nAndroudi S, Stangos A, Brazitikos PD.
