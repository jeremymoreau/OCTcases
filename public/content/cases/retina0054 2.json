          "explanation": "The OCT macula images demonstrate pigment epithelial detachment with hyper-reflective deposits at the level of the RPE (blue arrow), which coincide with the parafoveal hyper-pigmented lesions on the fundus photos. These deposits attenuate the ellipsoid zone (red arrow), which likely is the cause of the patient’s decrease in vision. Intra-retinal hyper-reflective foci are also seen bilaterally with this imaging modality (green arrow).\n\n![](/content/media/retina-54-5.webp)"

          "answerText": "B. Elmiron toxicity",
          "explanation": "Elmiron, or pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS), is a medical used for interstitial cystitis. Typically mistaken for macular degeneration or pattern dystrophy, patients on elmiron therapy can experience vision-threatening medication toxicity which mimics alternative maculopathies. Common presenting symptoms include blurred vision, prolonged dark adaptation and metamorphopsia, with vision ranging from 20/20 to 20/300.\n\nFundus examination demonstrates pigment mottling in the parafoveal region mimicking butterfly pattern dystrophy, and OCT imaging demonstrates hyper-reflective foci which may be mistaken for drusen in macular degeneration. However, chronic exposure to Elmiron is the inciting factor for these retinal changes, especially in patients with prolonged PPS use. With Elmiron being the only FDA-approved treatment for interstitial cystitis, targeted history-taking is crucial to elucidate this masquerading condition.\n\nReferences:\n\nPearce WA, Chen R, Jain N.

          "explanation": "A recent study documenting 35 PPS-associated maculopathy cases demonstrated that visual symptoms lasted for a median duration of 4 years following cessation of medication (range 1-9 years). Consultation with a family physician or urologist is crucial in initiating alternative treatments for interstitial cystitis.\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Li AL, Jain N, Yu Y, VanderBeek BL.

  "patientPresentation": "**Contributors:** Dr. Austin Pereira and Dr. Keyvan Koushan \n\nA 50-year-old female was referred to a tertiary ophthalmology clinic for progressive blurred vision in both eyes. The patient’s past medical history included a scleral buckle retinal detachment in the right eye one year prior, with no subsequent complications. Her past medical history included enteric colitis, chronic bladder inflammation, arthritis and fibromyalgia; medications included: baclofen, cetirizine, mometasone cream, cortisone injections and elmiron. His family history was significant for age-related macular degeneration.\n\nThe patient’s best corrected distance visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/30 OS with pressures within normal limits. Pupils were equal and reactive to light. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Fundus examination demonstrated parafoveal hyperpigmentation at the macula, as demonstrated in the fundus photos below:\n\n![](/content/media/retina-54-1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina-54-2.webp)\n\nBilateral OCT macula images were taken and are shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/retina-54-3.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina-54-4.webp)",
