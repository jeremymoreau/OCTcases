          "answerText": "A. Reticular pseudodrusens are located above the RPE while typical drusen are located under/within the RPE",
          "explanation": "Both reticular pseudodrusens and typical drusens have been associated with early AMD, and there is evidence supporting the involvement of both types of drusens in EOD, a condition where drusenoid deposits appear in younger individuals. While reticular pseudodrusens have some similarities in composition with typical drusens (neutral lipids, cholesterol, amyloid, complement factor, and membranous debris), there are several important differences. Specifically, the unique presence of immune-reactive microglia and macrophages in reticular pseudodrusens suggests an inflammatory role not seen with typical drusens. Other compositional differences seen in reticular pseudodrusens only include higher levels of unesterified cholesterol, vitronectin, opsins, peanut agglutinin, and photoreceptor pigments, though the exact composition of reticular pseudodrusens is unclear. To differentiate a reticular pseudodrusen from a typical drusen on examination, the use of multimodal imaging with at least two imaging methods is recommended. Spectral-domain OCT and infrared reflectance or fundus autofluorescence, in addition to color fundus photos, are beneficial to determine the exact layer the drusenoid deposits are present in. \n\n![](/content/media/retina56_16.webp)"
