          "explanation": "In the areas surrounded by the red boxes, choroidal hyper-transmission can be seen on the OCT scans in both eyes. This finding is a result of increased signal penetration through areas of RPE loss. Choroidal vessels may be seen under the areas of RPE loss on fundus examination. In the left eye, loss of the outer retinal layers is more easily seen, as well as the loss of the RPE in the area of hyper-transmission. An enlarged foveal depression can be seen in both eyes with significant thinning over the fovea (foveal atrophy). The inner retinal layers are relatively preserved. \n\n![](/content/media/r57-3.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/r57-4.webp)"

          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "C. Geographic atrophy",
          "explanation": "Geographic atrophy (GA) is a late-stage manifestation of dry AMD or other advanced macular diseases. It is characterized by loss of the RPE, photoreceptors, and choriocapillaris. Atrophy of these outer retinal layers can reveal the choroidal vessels underneath, resulting in a hyper-transmission signal on OCT due to loss of the cells in the area. On fundus examination, GA presents as hypopigmentation or depigmentation of the RPE with visible choroidal vessels.\n\nOn OCT, an active choroidal neovascular membrane often presents with accompanying intraretinal and/or subretinal fluid, which are not evident in this patient’s OCT scans. Disciform scars are the end-stage of exudative AMD in which the retinal tissue is replaced by scar tissue.  On OCT, a disciform scar appears as an area of sub-retinal or RPE hyper-reflective scar with marked destructions of all retinal layers. Macular retinoschisis is splitting of the neurosensory retina into an inner layer and an outer layer."

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "D. Observation with AREDS2 supplements, smoking avoidance, UV protection, healthy diet",
          "explanation": "There is currently no cure for GA. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are primarily used to treat wet AMD. High dose atorvastatin was associated with regression of large drusens and visual improvement in 10 out of 23 patients with severe dry AMD, but further large-scale studies are required to recommend statin therapy as a treatment for GA. There is little evidence in the use of laser in the management of GA. To decrease the probability of developing neovascular AMD, the patient is advised to continue with her AREDS2 supplements, avoid smoking/UV light, and eat a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables."

She complains of blurriness OU with a blind spot in the upper visual field of the right eye. Her ocular history is significant for bilateral cataract extraction done 12 years ago, and regular intravitreal ranibizumab injections in the right eye up until 10 years ago. She is taking Vitalux (AREDS2), dorzolamide-timolol and monoprost drops OU, sertraline, and pantoprazole. No significant FHx.
