          "explanation": "The OCT shows hyper-reflective dots in the vitreous (highlighted in red) with a shadowing effect (highlighted in blue) on the retina. These findings, in combination with the fundoscopy, is very suggestive of asteroid hyalosis (AH). There are no signs in the patient history suggestive of a vitreous hemorrhage, such as floaters, or vision loss. As well, the slit lamp and fundus examination was otherwise normal with no evidence of uveitis. There is also no reason to believe that the area highlighted in red below is an imaging artefact, especially in the context of the fundus findings in the right eye. \n\n![](/content/media/r58_3.webp)\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

          "explanation": "While asteroid hyalosis does not usually severely affect vision, the floating opacities can interfere significantly with the examination of the retina. As AH changes the optical quality of the vitreous, it can interfere with readings from automated technologies such as autorefraction, A-scan ultrasonography, axial length measurements, and IOL power calculations. However, the performance of cataract surgery itself has not been reported to be influenced by the presence of AH. Of note, however, silicone IOLs can calcify when implanted in eyes with asteroid hyalosis, making silicone an unacceptable material choice for these subjects. \n\nReferences:\n\nSebag J.
