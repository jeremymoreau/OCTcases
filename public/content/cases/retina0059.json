          "answerText": "E. C and D",
          "explanation": "On fundus examination, there are RPE changes near the fovea. On OCT, these pigmentary changes correlate with a hyper-reflective lesion under the fovea that presents as a raised separation between the RPE and Bruch’s Membrane. These findings are consistent with a pigment epithelial detachment. There are also several foci of hyper-reflective spots anterior to the PED. Subretinal fluid would appear hypo-reflective rather than hyper-reflective and often accumulates between the outer retina and RPE. There is no geographic atrophy seen on OCT. \n\n![](/content/media/r59_5.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/r59_6.webp)\n\nIn this separate OCT image, several hyper-reflective foci can also be seen here overlying drusenoid deposits in a patient with dry AMD. \n\n![](/content/media/r59_7.webp)"

          "answerText": "A. RPE cells",
          "explanation": "Histological studies have shown that in AMD presenting with drusenoid deposits, intraretinal hyper-reflective foci above the drusen are fully pigmented and nucleated RPE cells migrating anteriorly and likely represent progression of the disease."

          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "C. Greater risk of developing geographic atrophy",
          "explanation": "Drusens are a common finding in advanced AMD subtypes. With drusenoid PEDs, some studies have found a 50% chance of progression to geographic atrophy within 7 years, and this becomes reduced to 2 years if the drusen is larger than 2 disc-diameters or metamorphopsia is present in the initial visit. As RPE cells migrate anteriorly (presenting as hyper-reflective foci), the pigment epithelial layer loses cells and thins out and becomes atrophied, revealing choroidal vessels underneath. Hyper-reflective foci thus likely represent progression of AMD to later stages including geographic atrophy and choroidal neovascularization."
