          "explanation": "The OCT macula of the patient’s left eye is shown. There is subretinal fluid extending nasally from the sub-foveal region (yellow arrow). There is also an extrafoveal choroidal pit located nasal to the fovea, called a focal choroidal excavation (red arrow). Focal choroidal excavations (FCE) are concave choroidal pits, often seen in the macular region that was first termed in 2011 (Margolis et al., 2011). The etiology and pathogenesis of FCEs are not well understood but these are often visually asymptomatic on its own unless accompanied by concurrent disease.\n\n![](/content/media/r60_2.webp)\n\nReferences\n\nMargolis R, Mukkamala SK, Jampol LM, Spaide RF, Ober MD, Sorenson JA, Gentile RC, Miller JA, Sherman J, Freund KB.

          "explanation": "Focal choroidal excavations are categorized into two main types: conforming and non-conforming.  In conforming FCEs (shown below), the overlying RPE and outer retinal layers follow the outward curvature of the excavation.  In non-conforming FCEs, the overlying RPE and outer retinal layers do not follow the outward curvature of the excavation creating a hypo-reflective space in between. \n\n![](/content/media/r60_4.webp)"

          "explanation": "Focal choroidal excavations have been associated with all three of the conditions above although it is unclear whether these conditions lead to acquired FCEs or whether pre-existing, possibly congenital FCEs, predispose patients to these conditions (Verma et al., 2021).  It is these associated conditions that often lead to the patient’s visual symptoms.  As isolated FCEs are often asymptomatic and can be difficult to detect on fundoscopy, OCT remains the gold standard technique in diagnosing FCEs.\n\nReferences\nVerma S, Kumar V, Azad S, Bhayana AA, Surve A, Kumar S, Agarwal P, Chawla R, Venkatesh P.

In the setting of concurrent disease, such as with choroidal neovascularization, intervention with intravitreal anti-VEGF is a reasonable treatment option.

  "patientPresentation": "A 66-year-old male was referred for decreased vision and metamorphopsia OS.  His past ocular history is significant for central serous chorioretinopathy OS that self-resolved fifteen years ago.  His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type II, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a past episode of myocardial infarction.  His current medications include metformin, sitagliptin, empagliflozin, rosuvastatin, lisinopril, aspirin and albuterol. He had a 11-year smoking history.  On examination, BCVA is 20/30 OD and 20/60 OS.  There is no RAPD and IOP is stable. The patient’s OCT macula (OS) is shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/r60_1.webp)",
