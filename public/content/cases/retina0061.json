The foveal contour is elevated (blue brackets) due to the pathologic process occurring in the outer retinal layers. \n\n![](/content/media/r61_4.webp)"

          "answerText": "D. Angioid streaks",
          "explanation": "Angioid streaks are crack-like dehiscences occurring in the RPE/Bruch’s membrane complex, which were seen on fundus examination for this patient. On OCT, they appear as undulations and breaks to the outer retina – most often the RPE and Bruch’s complex but can extend into the photoreceptor layer and ellipsoid zone. On fundoscopy, they appear classically as bilateral, narrow, irregular lines deep to the retina configured in a radiating fashion emanating from the optic disc (see image below). \n\n​On OCT, the hyper-reflective material represents a CNVM which can occur secondary to angioid streaks (i.e. the breaks in the outer retinal layers) (2).  Myopia, trauma, and age-related macular degeneration are other causes of CNVM. In the absence of trauma, or fundus features suggestive of pathological myopia and macular degeneration, the cause of the CNVM is likely due to the angioid streaks in this case.  \n\n![](/content/media/r61_5.webp)\n\nFigure obtained from Traine et al 2019 (2)"

          "answerText": "A. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)",
          "explanation": "Angioid streaks are associated with several systematic diagnoses. The acronym ‘PEPSI’ can help you remember these: pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), Ehler-Danlos syndrome, Paget’s disease of bone, Sickle cell disease and hemoglobinopathies, and Idiopathic. PXE is an autosomal recessive heritable connective tissue disease which results in skin changes, vision loss and less commonly gastrointestinal bleeding and calcifications of arteries (3). Patients with PXE develop pathognomonic yellow popular lesions with a ‘cobblestoning’ appearance (shown below), often first seen in the neck area. Angioid streaks can lead to choroidal neovascular membrane, which may result in bleeding and accumulation of fluid leading to vision loss.  \n\n![](/content/media/r61_6.webp)"

          "explanation": "Patients with angioid streaks alone (without CNVM) often present asymptomatically and thus do not require treatment. However, this patient has CNVM associated with angioid streaks. Photocoagulation or photodynamic therapy may be used, however intravitreal anti-VEGF is generally recognized as the best first-line treatment for this."

  "patientPresentation": "A 57-year-old male was referred to ophthalmology for blurry vision in his right eye over the past 3 days. The patient’s past medical and ocular history were unremarkable. On external examination, you noticed yellow papules which appear like cobblestones on the patients neck and arms. The patient has not seen a physician about these lesions. On assessment, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30-2 OD and 20/25-2 OS. Refraction was -0.75 sph OU. Fundus exam showed angioid streaks emanating from the optic disc OU and a small area of hemorrhage in the macula.
