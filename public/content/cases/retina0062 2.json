          "answerText": "C. Drusenoid PEDs",
          "explanation": "The OCT demonstrates classic drusen, which are lipofuscin deposits under the retinal pigmented epithelium. In addition to the drusenoid PEDs, there are also several hyper-reflective foci anterior to the PED. Histological studies have shown that in AMD presenting with drusenoid deposits, intraretinal hyper-reflective foci above the drusen are fully pigmented and nucleated RPE cells migrating anteriorly and likely represent progression of the disease. As RPE cells migrate anteriorly (presenting as hyper-reflective foci), the pigment epithelial layer loses cells and atrophies, revealing choroidal vessels underneath. Hyper-reflective foci thus likely represent progression of AMD to later stages including geographic atrophy and choroidal neovascularization.\n\nReferences:\n\nGarcía-Layana A, Cabrera-López F, García-Arumí J, Arias-Barquet L, Ruiz-Moreno JM.

This is the standard-of-care treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The landmark clinical trials, VIEW 1 and 2, demonstrated high efficacy and safety up to 2 years for patients treated with intravitreal aflibercept for nAMD, with patients gaining 8.4 letters on a standardized ETDRS chart at week 52 compared to sham comparison. The safety profile was high for this treatment. \n\nReferences:\n\nKaiser PK, Singer M, Tolentino M, Vitti R, Erickson K, Saroj N, Berliner AJ, Chu KW, Zhu X, Williams Liu Z, Clark WL.

          "explanation": "This patient now presents with recurrence of her type 1 CNVM due to cessation and lack of maintenance of the anti-VEGF intravitreal injections. The key findings include the intraretinal cysts (blue arrow) and fibrovascular PEDs (green arrow), which were both present prior to Eylea treatment. However, the new key finding is the pre-choroidal cleft (red arrow). \n\n​Pre-choroidal clefts are hypo-reflective spaces sandwiched between two hyper-reflective bands, the RPE and the Bruch’s membrane. It is characterized by posterior bowing of the Bruch’s with overlying fibrovascular contractile tissue. These clefts can occur in 8.1 – 22.3% of treated nAMD eyes. The significance of pre-choroidal clefts are that the contractile tissue and hydrostatic forces lead to a risk of RPE rip, a splitting of the RPE-Bruch’s and recurrent subretinal hemorrhage.. Adherence of anti-VEGF injections and regular maintenance therapy is crucial to prevent this complication.\n\n![](/content/media/r62_9.webp)\n\nReferences:\n\nKim JM, Kang SW, Son DY, Bae K.
