          "answerText": "D. Well-circumscribed dark lesion in the superior temporal retina",
          "explanation": "There is a large well-demarcated area in the superior-temporal retina with sharp borders that appears to be darker than the surrounding retina. The appearance is not in keeping with a retinal detachment as there is no raised aspect to this lesion, and the patient is otherwise asymptomatic. Choroidal nevi can present as dark, pigmented lesions in the retina as well but this lesion is not in keeping with that of a nevi. The white streaks around the fovea are not drusen, but rather robust sheen of the retinal nerve fiber layer normally seen in children, where light reflects off the irregular macular surface.\n\n![](/content/media/r63_2.webp)"

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "D. Dark-without-pressure",
          "explanation": "Dark-without-pressure lesions are asymptomatic hypo-pigmented lesions due to changes in the outer retinal layers such as the Ellipsoid Zone and Photoreceptor Outer Segments. These lesions can change over time, but the clinical significance remains uncertain, as patients are asymptomatic when they present. The cause of these lesions is unknown, but likely reflects a structural and not functional deficit in the outer retina."

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "A. Benign finding",
          "explanation": "Over time, the lesions may grow or change shape or even disappear completely, but they are asymptomatic throughout their course. There have been no functional deficits reported in individuals who possess them. Treatment is not necessary. It is hypothesized that the density of photoreceptors in dark-without-pressure lesions are different from the rest of the retina, containing greater photoreceptors that absorb short wavelength light more effectively, resulting in its better visibility on red-free fundus photography."
