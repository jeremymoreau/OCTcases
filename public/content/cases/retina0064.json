Subretinal hyperreflective material (blue arrow) with underlying subretinal fluid can also be visualized in the right eye. The posterior hyaloid face is attached to the retina, there is no PVD. \n\n![](/content/media/r64-3.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/r64-4.webp)"

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "D. Radiation retinopathy (RR)",
          "explanation": "The patient’s blood pressure was not high enough to cause significant acute retinal damage (typically above 160s/100s) and he did not have a history of hypertension. CRVO typically shows more diffuse retinal hemorrhage, however exudates and edema may still occur. Radiation retinopathy (RR) can mimic diabetic retinopathy, therefore careful past medical history is important to rule in/out these entities. The patient was not diabetic, hypertensive, and did not have other vascular risk factors; RR is the most likely diagnosis. \n\nRR is more likely to occur in patients receiving external beam radiation above 45 Gy. Radiation exposure results in retinal ischemia due to endothelial cell damage from free radicals. This may result in microaneurysms, cotton wool spots, macular edema, hard exudates, retinal edema, telangiectasia, and perivascular sheathing. Radiation induced optic neuropathy (RION) may also cause vision loss if there is involvement of the optic chiasm or optic nerve. A diagnosis of RR can be made once other similar presenting conditions are ruled out."

          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "A. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy",
          "explanation": "Because VEGF is the pathologic stimulus for the development of radiation retinopathy, intravitreal anti-VEGF is the generally accepted as first line treatment. Intravitreal corticosteroids may be used as second line.  Photodynamic therapy and laser photocoagulation work to reduce VEGF production driven by ischemia but have been shown to have variable results in treating radiation retinopathy."

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "D. Any of the above",
          "explanation": "Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections q2-4 months have the strongest evidence for reducing incidence of radiation retinopathy and vision loss. However, pan-retinal photocoagulation and sub-tenon triamcinolone have also been shown to have benefit. These treatments are often combined for optimal prophylaxis. Because of reported instances of IOP spikes, periocular triamcinolone is not advised in glaucoma patients."

  "patientPresentation": "A 24-year-old male was referred because of painless blurred vision (OD > OS) for 1 month. His past medical history was significant for a pineal tumour which was treated by craniospinal radiation (36 Gy, 54 Gy and then 59.4 Gy). He did not have diabetes or hypertension. On exam, visual acuity was 20/150 OD and 20/40-1 OS. Colour vision was 0/12 OD and 7/14 OS. There was no RAPD. OCT macula was performed and shown below. \n\n![](/content/media/r64-1_tif.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/r64-2_tif.webp)",
