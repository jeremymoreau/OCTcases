          "explanation": "The patient likely has central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). \n\n![](/content/media/r65_5.webp)\n\nCSCR typically presents with subretinal fluid (SRF), but no intraretinal fluid, and a thickened choroid (pachychoroid). \n\nThe choroid, which is highly vascularized, becomes thickened and congested with increased blood vessel diameter in the Haller’s Layer. This leads to greater pressure from the choroid, which results in compressed choriocapillaris and RPE dysfunction. This RPE dysfunction leads to SRF accumulation. \n\nFurthermore, there are factors known to increase the risk of CSR. CSR occurs more commonly in males (male:female ratio of 6:1) and is exacerbated by stress and corticosteroid use. Other risk factors include hypertension and Cushing’s syndrome.\n\n​References:\n\nHaimovici R, Koh S, Gagnon DR, Lehrfeld T, Wellik S.

          "explanation": "Swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) provides the best visualization of the choroid.\n\nCompared to spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT), SS-OCT provides greater control of imaging depth and improved penetrance of the choroid. SS-OCT uses a narrow band of light swept through a wide range of frequencies. However, SS-OCT provides a lower resolution than SD-OCT for neurosensory retinal structures. \n\nReference:\nhttps://www.octcases.com/background-to-oct"

          "answerText": "D. Expectant Management",
          "explanation": "In acute central serous chorioretinopathy, subretinal fluid collects due to leakage of fluid secondary to increased capillary pressure in the choroid. For this reason, anti-VEGF agents, which reduce the formation of new vessels in response to ischemia, are not significantly effective in treating CSR.\n\nIn this case, the best treatment is expectant management, with a recommendation to reduce stress or any alternative risk factors. The accumulation of SRF typically resolves with time as it is resorbed by the RPE (approximately 3-6 months). As this fluid resolves, metamorphopsia symptoms should also resolve. In cases of non-resolving CSR, sub-threshold micropulse laser treatment has been shown to be safe and effective in improving visual acuity and can be considered. An IVFA is crucial to determine the area of leakage for focal laser treatment. \n\nBelow is an example of CSR (left) that has resolved after 3 months of expectant management (right)\n\n![](/content/media/r65_6.webp)\n\nReferences:\n\nPark S-U, Lee S-J, Kim M.
