          "explanation": "This patient has both an epiretinal membrane and a separation of the posterior hyaloid from the macula. You can appreciate the detached posterior hyaloid as the faint white line floating in the vitreous (blue arrow), indicating the vitreous gel is beginning to separate posteriorly but is still attached to the optic disc. There is a trace epiretinal membrane indicated by the hyperreflective line on the inner surface of the retina (red arrow).\n\n![](/content/media/r66_2.webp)"

          "answerText": "C. Lamellar hole or full thickness macular hole",
          "explanation": "A lamellar hole can develop when proliferation of an epiretinal membrane results in thickening of the macula and change to the retinal architecture with the appearance of a “pseudohole”. A full thickness macular hole is a known complication of a posterior vitreous detachment at its earliest stages. It is theorized that the macular hole is caused by tangential traction on the fovea, as well as anterior posterior vitreoretinal traction of the posterior hyaloid on the parafovea (1)."

          "answerText": "B. Change in foveal contour",
          "explanation": "There is a steepening of the foveal contour centrally (red circle) with alteration in the lamination of the retina and disruption of the photoreceptor-RPE complex. This is most likely related to the persistent epiretinal membrane. Note that a posterior vitreous detachment has now occurred and the posterior hyaloid is no longer visible.\n\n![](/content/media/r66_4.webp)"

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "A. Full thickness macular hole",
          "explanation": "This shows a full thickness macular hole. A classic finding seen here is the “anvil-shaped” deformity of the edges of the retina due to intraretinal edema. It is important to distinguish this from a lamellar hole, which tends to have an irregular foveal contour with a defect in the inner fovea, but in-tact outer retina. Additionally, a pseudohole has an irregular foveal contour with steep edges with no loss of retinal tissue (2).\n\nThis case highlights that full thickness macular holes (FTMH) don’t always develop from focal vitreomacular traction to the fovea. In the January 2020 OCT, you can see that the posterior hyaloid is separated from the macula, although it is still attached to the optic disc. One year later (February 2021), a posterior vitreous detachment had developed, although there was no sign of a FTMH, and the epiretinal membrane remained mild (3).\n\n​It wasn’t until August 2021 that a FTMH developed. There are a very small subset of FTMHs that develop from epiretinal membrane proliferation causing centrifugal force, which is highlighted by this case (4). This case is unusual as the epiretinal membrane was very mild and did not lead to thickening prior to the development of a FTMH."
