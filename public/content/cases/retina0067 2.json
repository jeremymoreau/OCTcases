          "explanation": "![](/content/media/r67_5.webp)\n\nThe hypo-reflective area indicated by the yellow arrow is indicative of fluid accumulation. The fluid is accumulating above the retinal pigment epithelium (subretinal fluid), leading to separation of the overlying neurosensory retina. There is also evidence of intra-retinal fluid indicated by the red arrows, as well as schisis changes due to separation of the inner plexiform/outer nuclear layer. Cystoid macular edema tends to present with cystic changes in the outer plexiform layers in a petaloid pattern, rather than at the pigment epithelium. There is no separation of the RPE from Bruch’s membrane. The choroidal vessels are within normal limits."

          "explanation": "![](/content/media/r67_6.webp)\n\nMorning Glory Disc Anomaly classically presents with an excavated optic disc with peripapillary atrophy (blue arrows), and a central glial tuft (red arrow). The retinal vasculature also appears straightened and extends radially from the optic disc. It is thought that Morning Glory Disc Anomaly occurs due to incomplete closure of the posterior sclera and embryonic fissure at weeks 4-5, leading to herniation of the optic disc and failure of normal development. The main differential diagnosis of Morning Glory Disc Anomaly includes optic disc coloboma, which also presents as an excavation of the nerve, but tends to occur in the inferior portion, sparing the superior segment of the optic disc, and does not contain the central glial tuft or peripapillary involvement. Optic disc coloboma does not present with abnormal retinal vasculature as well."

          "explanation": "Morning Glory Syndrome is associated with basal encephalocele (67.6%), a bony defect of the base of the skull which can lead to herniation of cranial contents, serous retinal detachment, which was seen in this case (30%), and Moyamoya disease (15% in some studies), a neurovascular arteriopathy of the internal carotid arteries that can predispose an individual to develop strokes in times of emotional duress. The association with choroidal neovascularization is much rarer and more atypical in this condition but have been documented in case reports."

          "answerText": "A. MRI brain, MRI angiography, OCT macula",
          "explanation": "As Morning Glory Syndrome is associated with basal encephalocele and Moyamoya disease, an MRI/MRA of the brain is recommended to monitor for herniation of the brain and abnormal cranial vasculature. An OCT is also recommended to monitor for retinal changes such as detachment. In some studies, pituitary gland abnormalities have been identified. However, as Morning Glory Disc Anomaly often presents as an isolated ocular finding, endocrinological testing may not be warranted if there are no other systemic signs present (short stature, low birth weight in children). If there is a transsphenoidal encephalocele, the patient may have midline defects and hypopituitarism, and an endocrinology panel should be performed."
