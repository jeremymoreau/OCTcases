          "explanation": "The patient has a disease known as paracentral acute middle maculopathy (PAMM). It is a rare condition characterized by the presence of hyperreflective band-like lesions, typically in the middle retina at the level of the inner nuclear layer (red arrows). These lesions can also be seen as areas of hypo-autofluorescence on FAF. Over time, OCT imaging may reveal eventual atrophy of the inner nuclear layer.\n\n![](/content/media/retina68_4.webp)"

          "explanation": "Although OCT angiography is not required for the diagnosis of PAMM, it may be useful in ruling out an occult central retinal artery occlusion which may appear similar to diffuse PAMM lesions.  Central retinal artery occlusions warrant further investigation to rule out embolic etiologies and when applicable, thrombotic diseases such as giant cell arteritis. In this case, OCT-A revealed only minimal areas of hypoperfusion in the middle retina of the right eye and no signs of a central retinal artery occlusion.\n\n![](/content/media/retina68_5.webp)"

          "answerText": "E: Optimization of vascular risk factors",
          "explanation": "Currently, there are no specific therapies that treat PAMM. Since PAMM is believed to be caused by microvascular retinal ischemia, management involves optimizing vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Most patients experience significant recovery of their vision within a few months, although many will still notice their scotomas or a feeling of dimmer vision compared to their contralateral eye."

  "patientPresentation": "**Contributor:** Arshia Eshtiaghi (CC3)\n\nA 45-year-old man presented with a 3-day history of painless blurred vision of his right eye. He had subjectively lost vision in his right eye 3 days prior to presentation, but regained most of his vision a few hours later. He denied any headache, flashes, floaters or field deficit during this acute, transient loss of vision episode. His past medical history includes hypertension that is not currently being treated.\n\nHe now reports that he sees \"broken glass\" through his right eye. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity is 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. IOP was within normal limits; there is no RAPD. Fundus examination is shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/retina68_1_new.webp)",
