          "explanation": "As per the 2019 PIVOT trial (The Pneumatic Retinopexy versus Vitrectomy for the Management of Primary Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment Outcomes Randomized Trial), the preferred treatment of primary RRD is pneumatic retinopexy.\n\nThe PIVOT trial found that PnR achieved greater visual acuity, reduced vertical metamorphopsia, and reduced morbidity after surgery compared to patients with RRD treated with PPV​. \n\nReferences:\n\n​Hillier, R.

          "explanation": "The white structures are outer retinal folds, which are partial-thickness folds of the outer retina. They are characterized by vertical or oblique protrusions of the photoreceptor layers, with base-to-base photoreceptor apposition and infolding of the external limiting membrane (ELM) and the ellipsoid zone (EZ), with or without protrusion of the outer nuclear layer.\n\n​The cross-sectional OCT here shows segmentation from the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layer junction (black arrowhead) to the myoid zone and ellipsoid zone (white arrowhead). This verifies the presence of ORFs.\n\n![](/content/media/retina_69_2.webp)\n\nReferences:\n\n​Lee, W. W., Bansal, A., Sadda, S. R., Sarraf, D., Berger, A. R., Wong, D. T., ... & Muni, R. H. (2022).

          "explanation": "A recent study compared the incidence of ORFs after PPV to PnR in patients with primary macula-off RRD. \n\nWithin 1 month of surgery, 14/41 PPV patients developed ORFs compared to 6/42 of PnR patients (p = 0.034). After 3 months, ORFs resolved partially in both groups, with ORFs persisting in 4/41 PPV patients and 3/42 PnR patients. At 6 months, all ORFs resolved, except for a single patient with a single persistent ORF, which resolved by 8 months. \n\n​From this study, ORFs are more likely to develop after PPV compared to PnR.\n\n​References:\n\n​Lee, W.

  "patientPresentation": "**Contributors:** Shaan Bhambra MD, Wei Wei Lee MD FRCSC\n\nA 62-year old male presented to the emergency room after experiencing flashes and floaters for a week OD. He denied past medical or ocular history, though he did note a glasses prescription of -5.50D OU.  His vision was 20/200 OD and 20/25 OS. IOP was 11 OD and 14 OS; there was no RAPD. Anterior segment examination was within normal limits, though the vitreous was Shafer's sign positive OD. Fundus examination demonstrated a macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) extending from 11 to 3 o'clock with a single retinal tear at 12 o'clock OD.",
