          "explanation": "The OCT macula of the left eye demonstrated a hypo-reflective dome-shaped space separating the neurosensory retinal layers from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (blue arrows). This is characteristic of neurosensory retinal detachment secondary to the accumulation of subretinal fluid (asterix). There is also evidence of small pigment epithelial detachments or slight separation of the RPE with the underlying Bruch’s membrane (double layer sign) (red arrows), as seen by the slight undulation in the RPE layer, revealing the inner layer of Bruch’s membrane (orange arrow). Large choroidal vessels or pachyvessels be appreciated as seen by the green arrows.\n\n​There is no hyper-reflective layer on the inner limiting membrane to suggest an epi-retinal membrane. Additionally, the preretinal space is diffusely hyporeflective with no evidence of hyperreflective foci in the vitreous to suggest vitreous inflammation.\n\n![](/content/media/retina_71_2.webp)"

          "explanation": "Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a common idiopathic disorder that involves localized serous detachment of the neurosensory retina. CSCR falls within the pachychoroid disease spectrum, which is a constellation of diseases characterized by engorged Haller’s layer vessels in the choroid with choriocapillaris attenuation. In CSCR, this leads to subretinal fluid accumulation. The classic presentation involves decrease in vision in one eye of a young or middle-aged male. Risk factors for CSCR include hypertension, use of corticosteroids, male gender, Helicobacter pylori infection, type A personality and psychological stress.\n\n​References:​\n\nHaimovici R, Koh S, Gagnon DR, Lehrfeld T, Wellik S, Central Serous Chorioretinopathy Case–Control Study Group.

          "answerText": "C. Observation",
          "explanation": "CSCR has two subtypes: acute and chronic. The acute subtype typically spontaneously resolves within 3-6 months with return to near-normal or normal vision in 80% of patients. A minority of patients follow a chronic course exceeding 12 months in duration. Management of CSCR typically involves observation with eventual resolution. In some cases, other treatment modalities may be considered. Although there are multiple treatment options ranging from oral medications to intravitreal injections to subthreshold laser to focal laser to photodynamic therapy, there is no definitive cure for this condition at this time.\n\n​Reference:​\n\nNicholson B, Noble J, Forooghian F, Meyerle C.

          "answerText": "B. Choroidal neovascular membrane",
          "explanation": "The OCT demonstrated choroidal neovascular membranes as shown by the subretinal hyperreflective material (red arrows). This entity is termed pachychoroid neovasculopathy. Enlarged choroidal vessels (green arrow) appear to have obliterated the choriocapillaris and Sattler’s layer, with additional disruption to the RPE/Bruch’s membrane (blue arrows) resulting in several undulations of the RPE. This blue arrow demonstrates the classic “double layer sign.”\n\n![](/content/media/retina_71_4.webp)\n\nPachychoroid spectrum is a term describing a group of clinical ophthalmologic diseases that share a common characteristic of choroidal thickening with pachyvessels. This spectrum of diseases includes pachychoroid neovasculopathy (PNV), pachychoroid pigment epitheliopathy, central serous chorioretinopathy, and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.\n\n​Choroidal neovascular membranes (CNVM) secondary to PVN can be seen on OCT imaging and can be classified based on their location relative to the RPE. Type 1 CNVM is located beneath the RPE layer (i.e. outer layer) and appears as a hyperreflective material suggestive of fibrovascular or hemorrhagic RPE detachment. Type 2 CNVM is located above the RPE layer (i.e. inner layer) with adjacent subretinal fluid leakage. Type 3 CNVM involves retinal angiomatous proliferation with the presence of small intra- and sub-retinal hemorrhages being a hallmark feature for early clinical diagnosis. PNV has been specifically described in recent studies as a type 1 CNVM.\n\n​References:\n\n1. Sartini F, Figus M, Casini G, Nardi M, Posarelli C.
