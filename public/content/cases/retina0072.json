          "explanation": "The OCT macula of the right eye demonstrated a hypo-reflective dome-shaped space separating the neurosensory retinal layers from the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). This is characteristic of neurosensory retinal detachment secondary to the accumulation of subretinal fluid (red arrow). There is no hyper-reflective layer on the inner limiting membrane to suggest an epi-retinal membrane. There is no discontinuation of RPE layer or increased hyperreflectivity that would suggest RPE atrophy.\n\n![](/content/media/retina_72_2.webp)"

          "explanation": "Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is a common idiopathic disorder that involves localized serous detachment of the neurosensory retina. CSCR falls within the pachychoroid disease spectrum, which is a constellation of diseases characterized by engorged Haller’s layer vessels in the choroid with choriocapillaris attenuation. In CSCR, this leads to subretinal fluid accumulation. The classic presentation involves decrease in vision in one eye of a young or middle-aged male. Risk factors for CSCR include hypertension, use of corticosteroids, male gender, Helicobacter pylori infection, type A personality and psychological stress.\n\n​\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

          "answerText": "C. Conforming focal choroidal excavation",
          "explanation": "This is a conforming focal choroidal excavation(FCE). It is acquired secondary to pachychoroid choroidal neovascular membrane following central serous chorioretinopathy.\n\nFocal choroidal excavation (FCE) is a concavity in the choroid detected by optical coherence tomography (OCT) that was originally described by Jampol et al. in 2006 and named by Margolis et al. in 2011. Despite FCE classically being considered to be congenital there have been reports of acquired FCE following choroidal neovascular membrane CNVM and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS). This has led to the pathogenesis and prognosis of FCE being unclear, with a recent review by Verma et al. proposing an etiology- based classification where FCE is characterized as congenital/primary (i.e., no associated evidence of any other chorioretinal disease; generally stable and do not threaten vision) or acquired/secondary (i.e., acquired after birth; may progress and threaten vision).\n\n​FCE can be acquired after pachychoroid spectrum disorders such as CSR and pCNVM. The mechanism of acquired FCE from CSR and pCNVM may be related to focal choroidal ischemia, collapse of choroid vessels, and fibrosis. Furthermore, FCE appears to be associated with the pachychoroid spectrum of diseases.\n\n![](/content/media/retina_72_6.webp)\n\nReferences:\n\n1. Jampol LM, Shankle J, Schroeder R et al.
