          "answerText": "B. Pre-choroidal cleft",
          "explanation": "Pre-choroidal clefts are seen as a hypo-reflective cavity between Bruch’s membrane and hyper-reflective material in PEDs on OCT imaging. They can be seen in 8.1% - 22.3% of eyes treated for neovascular AMD and are thought to represent exudative fluid leakage from choroidal neovascularization fibrous membranes \\[1,2]. The presence of a pre-choroidal cleft has been associated with poorer visual prognosis and type 3 CNV \\[2,3]."

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "A. RPE tear",
          "explanation": "A study by Mukai et al. in 2014 revealed that RPE tear can occur in up to 23% of patients with a pre-choroidal cleft \\[1]. In patients treated with anti-VEGF agents, there was a greater incidence of RPE tear in eyes with pre-choroidal clefts than in eyes without \\[2]. Mechanisms of the tear are thought to involve contraction of the choroidal neovascularization membranes resulting in tensile forces that tear at edges of the detached RPE \\[4] Thus, close monitoring of eyes with neovascular AMD is recommended to detect development of these clefts, and patients should be counselled on the risk of complications following anti-VEGF treatment such as RPE tears."

  "patientPresentation": "A 78-year-old man was referred to a tertiary retina clinic for decreased vision OS. The patient denied red eye, flashes, floaters, scalp tenderness, or jaw claudication. He had a 40-pack year smoking history. Ocular history was significant for cataract extraction OU and dry AMD, which was monitored by his optometrist.\n\nHis visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/100 OS. There was no RAPD. IOP was within normal limits. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Fundus examination demonstrated numerous medium – large sized drusen OU with no sign of hemorrhage.\n\nOCT macula images were taken and shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/retina1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina2.webp)",
