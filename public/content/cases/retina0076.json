This cavity runs temporally and can be seen in the peripheral OCT scan of the left eye (green arrow). Although there is slight doming, there is incomplete loss of the foveal contour, and it can still be appreciated (yellow arrow). There is no hyper-reflective membrane along the inner retina to suggest an epiretinal membrane.\n\n​\n\n![](/content/media/699564_204c5293c8c84ad8878968164bf9e4fe~mv2.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/699564_188e7a507f374b6997f84d1b60f774b4~mv2.webp)"

In this OCT, we can see hypo-reflective cavities within the outer nuclear layer (ONL; yellow arrow). It can be difficult to delineate retinal layers when pathology is present; a good way to orient oneself is to look for the two nuclear layers which appear dark on OCT (yellow arrows).\n\n![](/content/media/699564_bf66fc4e3d6a498098dbd4a34b920ed7~mv2.webp)"

          "explanation": "Fluorescein angiography (FA) can be used to differentiate retinoschisis and cystoid macular edema. CME will leak on fluorescein angiography while retinoschisis usually does not \\[1,2]. The acronym DEPRIVES (Diabetes, Epinephrine, Pars Planitis/Uveitis, Retinitis Pigmentosa, Irvine-Gass, Vein Occlusion, E2-prostaglandin, and Surgery) is a useful tool to remember risk factors that cause FA leakage \\[2]. The FA images above lack fluorescein leakage suggesting the patient has some form of retinoschisis \\[1]."

          "explanation": "Retinoschisis has varied etiologies; SNIFR affects the macula of patients without identifiable hereditary or ocular risk factors for retinoschisis (eg. lack of mutation in RS1 or medication induced) \\[3]. The pathogenesis of SNIFR is not well understood; as such, it is a diagnosis of exclusion \\[3,4,5,6]. Since our patient is not taking any medication and has no past ocular or family history, SNIFR is the most likely diagnosis. Although this case of SNIFR presented in a male, the disease predominantly affects females and typically presents unilaterally \\[4,6]. There is lack of evidence as to which treatments are most effective \\[4]; SNIFR is typically managed by observation as most patients have minimal symptoms \\[3,4,5,6]."

  "patientPresentation": "**Contributors:** Korolos Sawires MD (C) and Dr. R. Rishi Gupta MD, FRCSC, FASRS\n\nPatient presentation: A 62-year-old man was referred to a tertiary retina clinic for presumed cystoid macular edema (CME) in the left eye. The patient noted progressive painless blurring of his vision OS over the last few years. His past medical, family, and ocular history were unremarkable. He was emmetropic and not taking any medications.\n\nBest corrected distance visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/100 OS (pinhole 20/40) with an IOP of 16 mmHg in both eyes. Slit lamp examination revealed 1+ nuclear sclerotic cataract OD and a 2+ nuclear sclerotic cataract with posterior subcapsular component OS. There was no intraocular inflammation.\n\nFundus, fundus autofluorescence and near infrared photographs were taken and are shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/retina_76_1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina_76_2.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina_76_3.webp)",
