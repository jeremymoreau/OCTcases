          "answerText": "B. Macular telangiectasia type 2",
          "explanation": "Macular telangiectasia type 2 (or mac tel) is a degenerative disease leading to capillary abnormalities in the foveal or perifoveal region. This atypical retinal vasculature leads to loss of outer retinal banding (notably the EZ layer) and outer nuclear layers, ultimately progressing to cavitation of the neurosensory retinal layers. First described by Gass in 1968, histopathology has recently demonstrated disruption of pericytes, RPE hyperplasia, and dilated retinal venules, which typically dive at a right angle into deeper retinal layers, are hallmarks of disease. The Mac Tel Project from Lowy Medical Research Institute found that Mac Tel has a strong association with diabetes (28%) and hypertension (52%), suggesting that vascular stress can be an etiology for this disease. Macular telangiectasia is typically classified into 3 categories: type 1 (congenital and unilateral with more exudates, possibly a Coats disease variant), type 2 (acquired, bilateral, most common), and type 3 (occlusive disease, most rare)."

          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "D. Observation",
          "explanation": "This patient has no clinical signs or features on OCT of choroidal neovascularization. Therefore, as Mac Tel is a degenerative disease, there is no treatment required for this patient. However, regular monitoring with OCT and OCT angiography to ensure no choroidal neovascularization occurs is crucial. The Mac Tel Project found that 60% of type 2 patients had a visual acuity better than 20/50, with only 4% having vision of 20/200 or worse. Intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy remains the hallmark of treatment for new blood vessels, though there are currently no RCTs investigating its efficacy compared to PDT. A randomized trial also found that intravitreal ciliary neurotrophic factor slowed the progression of retinal degeneration in macular telangiectasia type 2, yet further research is needed to better understand its long-term outcomes."

  "description": "58M referred for atypical retinal examination OU",
  "patientPresentation": "A 58-year-old woman was referred to a tertiary retina clinic by her optometrist due to an atypical retinal examination. She did note her visual acuity had progressively declined over the last 2 years, but she was informed by another eye care provider that it was due to refractive error. Her past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, both of which were controlled with oral medications. She had no past ocular history. BCVA was 20/40 OD and 20/50 OS. IOP was normal and there was no RAPD. Anterior segment examination demonstrated 1+ nuclear sclerotic cataracts OU. Fundus photographs and fundus autofluorescence images were taken and are shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/retina771.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/retina772.webp)",
