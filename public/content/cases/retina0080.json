There is a rim of chorioretinal atrophy (B), which corresponds to the ring of hyper-autofluorescence on FAF imaging.\n\n![](/content/media/retina802.avif)"

          "answerText": "B. Cystic retinal tuft",
          "explanation": "Given the localized elevation, intra-retinal localization, lack of subretinal fluid, and far-peripheral location, this lesion is consistent with a retinal tuft. Cystic retinal tufts are a congenital abnormality of the peripheral retina associated with firm vitreoretinal adhesions. They can be found in approximately 5% of the population, and have been associated with retinal detachments, though the risk of RD is less than 1%."

          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "Show Answer",
          "explanation": "Since the patient is asymptomatic, and the likelihood of progression to a retinal tear is low, the lesion can be managed with regular ophthalmic examination. However, the patient should be adequately counselled on the symptoms of retinal tear and detachment, including increased floaters, flashing lights, or development of a visual field deficit. Primary laser barricade may be considered in high myopes, those with a history of retinal tear/detachment, or high risk activities such as contact sports (1)."

  "patientPresentation": "**Contributor**: Julia Di Ianni, COMT\n\nPatient presentation: A 28-year-old female was referred to a tertiary retina clinic by her optometrist following a routine eye examination, which found a suspicious retinal lesion OD. The patient was asymptomatic. With spectacle correction of -2.25D OD and -2.75D OS, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Fundus examination of the left eye was unremarkable. Widefield fundus photograph and fundus autofluorescence images of the right eye were obtained and are shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/retina801.avif)",
