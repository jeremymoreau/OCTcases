          "answerText": "C. Pachychoroid Pigment Epitheliopathy (PPE)",
          "explanation": "PPE, first described by Warrow et al. in 2013, is part of the pachychoroid disease spectrum (PDS) (1). PPE is typically asymptomatic and often considered a \"silent\" disease, although metamorphopsia (\"wavy lines\") can occur. PPE is characterized on multimodal imaging by increased choroidal thickness, pachyvessels, and overlying focal RPE irregularities without evidence of current or previous subretinal fluid (SRF) (1-2). While small PEDs may be present in PPE patients, the absence of SRF or serous PEDs is a key distinguishing feature from CSC (1-2). PPE is considered a \"forme fruste\" of CSC, with possible conversion to and from CSC (1-3). Recent clinical advances have demonstrated that CSC, similar to PPE, is on the spectrum of PDS (4).\n\n​\n\nPPE can be differentiated from PNV and PCV by the absence of a “double-layer sign” on OCT and the lack of CNV on OCT-A (2). Additionally, inflammatory diseases such as VKH, which can also cause choroidal thickening, should be considered in the differential but typically present with additional signs of systemic and ocular inflammation."

        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "Show answer",
          "explanation": "The pachychoroid disease spectrum represents several macular disorders that share an underlying pathogenesis involving distinct choroidal alterations (5-7). Common clinical features include subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) >300 µm and pachyvessels (5-7). The main entities within this spectrum include PPE, CSC, PNV (Aneurysmal Type 1 Neovascularization), and PCV. Additional pachychoroid variants include focal choroidal excavation (FCE), peripapillary pachychoroid syndrome (PPS), and the recently described pachy-vitelliform maculopathy (PVM).\n\n​\n\nRecent advances in multimodal imaging have offered insights into pachychoroid pathophysiology, highlighting the role of choroidal venous congestion as a driving factor and emphasizing changes beyond choroidal thickness as defining features. Impaired venous outflow at the vortex veins, observed on indocyanine green angiography (ICG-A), leads to choriocapillaris hyperpermeability and choroidal anastomosis, eventually causing dilation of Haller’s layer vessels (2, 8-9). Our understanding of the pachychoroid spectrum will likely continue to evolve as new insights emerge."

  "description": "47M referred for wavy lines in central vision OU",
  "patientPresentation": "**Contributor**: Dr. David Rabinovitch\n\nPatient presentation: A 47-year-old man was referred to a tertiary retina clinic for a two-month history of “wavy lines” in his central vision OU. He denied flashes, floaters or a visual field deficit. His past medical history was significant for hypertension and migraines, managed with ramipril and Tylenol PRN, respectively. His ocular history was unremarkable.\n\nOn examination, his visual acuity was 20/30+2 in the right eye (OD) and 20/20-1 in the left eye (OS). IOP was within normal limits and there was no RAPD. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable. Fundus photographs and fundus autofluorescence images were obtained and shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/retina_81_1.avif)\n\n![](/content/media/retina_81_2.avif)",
