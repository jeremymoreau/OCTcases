          "answerText": "A. Reticular pseudodrusen",
          "explanation": "Reticular pseudodrusen are a subtype of drusen in which yellow subretinal lesions are often connected in reticular network and typically start in the supero-temporal macula due to the highest rod photoreceptor density. Compared to typical drusenoid deposits at Bruch’s membrane, reticular drusen carries a higher risk of progression to late age-related macular degeneration, especially geographic atrophy.\n\n​\n\nLarge colloidal drusen presents as subretinal material in between the RPE and Bruch’s membrane. Cuticular or basal laminar drusen involves the subretinal structures and will typically demonstrate a ‘starry sky appearance’ on fluorescein angiography. Lastly, laser marks on the retina should be considered if the lesions are distributed in a discrete region of the macula/retina when there is a history of retinal layers (especially if findings are only present in one eye)."
