          "explanation": "The most prominent finding is the large pigment epithelium detachment (PED) in the nasal macula OD in the right eye (red cross) with multiple subfoveal PEDs. We can also appreciate the double-hump sign (white arrows), where a smaller PED is directly adjacent to a larger PED with an overlying pocket of subretinal fluid. This OCT biomarker is highly specific to a certain diagnosis, which will be discussed later in this case. In the left eye, we can appreciate drusenoid PEDs with no intra- or subretinal fluid. The remaining retinal architecture is maintained in both eyes. \n\n![](/content/media/retina_84_2.avif)"

          "answerText": "D. Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV)",
          "explanation": "PCV is a disease of the choroidal vasculature resulting in macular neovascularization and hemorrhage. PCV involves the formation of a network of branching choroidal vessels with terminal, polyp-like aneurysmal dilations that leak. It primarily affects Asians and African Americans, and typically presents in the 6th to 7th decade of life (1). The hallmark of PCV is the polypoidal lesion, an orange-red nodule found in the macula. OCT typically shows serosanguinous PEDs and the double-hump sign as described above (2)."

          "answerText": "B. Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA)",
          "explanation": "The best imaging modality for differentiating PCV from other types of neovascularization is indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) (1). The indocyanine green (ICG) molecule is excited by the absorption of infrared light (790-805 nm), compared to fluorescein angiography, which uses a shorter wavelength of light (490 nm). In addition, ICG is more protein-bound than fluorescein dye. Therefore, ICG more effectively highlights choroidal circulation pathology. These dilations appear as distinct, nodular \"polypoidal lesions\" and are best seen in the first six minutes of the ICGA (4)."

          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "E. A and/or D",
          "explanation": "There are various treatment options for PCV, including PDT monotherapy with verteporfin, anti-VEGF monotherapy, combination therapy with anti-VEGF and PDT, and thermal laser photocoagulation for extra-foveal lesions (4). The first-line treatment for PCV is usually anti-VEGF monotherapy. Anti-VEGF monotherapy is especially useful when significant hemorrhage or exudation precludes the visualization of polyps of ICGA, and when PDT cannot be undertaken. PDT uses laser energy (689 nm) to activate verteporfin, a photosensitizing agent (5,6). This promotes vaso-occlusion of pathologic blood vessels. It is recommended that PDT treatment be performed for the entire PCV lesion and not just the actively leaking polyps."
