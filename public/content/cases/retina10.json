Perfused retina from cilioretinal artery\n​\nThe retinal veins appear to be normal in colour and contour. Venous tortuosity is not commonly found in this condition. The vessels that are affected in this condition are the retinal arteries.\n\n![](/content/media/retina-10-3.webp)\n\nFor the above fundus photo:​\n\n1. The orange arrow is pointing to an embolus in the retinal arteriole. \n2. The blue arrows are demonstrating filling defects in the retinal venules (boxcarring).\n3. The black arrow is demonstrating a spared cilioretinal artery with a small area of perfused retina"

          "explanation": "The Diagnosis is Central Retinal Artery Occlusion\n\nCentral retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) occurs when the central retinal artery becomes obstructed at a point before entry into the optic nerve (although sometimes you can visualize small dislodged emboli as in a branch retinal artery occlusion). It is usually secondary to an embolic process. In the acute phase, the OCT will reveal hyper-reflectivity of the inner retinal layers as a result of nerve fiber layer edema. However, with resolution of edema, retinal atrophy and loss of the foveal depression may be seen in the chronic stages on OCT."
