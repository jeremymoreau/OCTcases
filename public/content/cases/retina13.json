As the NFL travels closer to the optic nerve (red arrow), it becomes thicker and more noticeable. By determining the position of the optic nerve relative to the position of the macula, it is often possible to identify whether an OCT is the right eye or left eye."

The external limiting membrane is  visualized well sub-foveally but cannot be identified when followed outwards away from the fovea."

          "explanation": "Hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) is a medication commonly used in the treatment of various rheumatological diseases including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. Both choroquine and hydroxychloroquine can result in irreversible macular toxicity and classically disrupts the outer retina parafoveally. When macular toxicity is evident clinically and on OCT, advanced disease is already present. Both OCT and multi-focal ERG are recommended screenings to rule out toxicity."

  "patientPresentation": "A 56-year-old female was referred to ophthalmology after she noticed blurred central vision in both eyes over a period of 2 months. She is currently taking medications for rheumatoid arthritis. On examination, vision is 20/30 in both eyes. Fundus photographs demonstrate non-specific RPE changes in the macula. The OCT macula is shown below:\nâ€‹\n\n![](/content/media/retina-13-1.webp)",

By the time macular toxicity is evident clinically on retinal examination or OCT, advanced disease is already present. \n2. Saucer sign is the classic OCT sign associated with plaquenil toxicity and occurs due to the relative sparing of the subfoveal structures relative to the para-foveal loss of the outer retinal structures."
