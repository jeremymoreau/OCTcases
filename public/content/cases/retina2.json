The foveal contour is preserved."

Observation would be the correct option in this case.​\n​\nVitrectomy may be useful in managing certain cases of ERM associated with significant visual acuity loss and disabling metamorphopsia. The decision to perform surgery should not be made based solely on OCT findings."
