          "explanation": "The Management is **Surgical Intervention**\n\n\nSince this is a full-thickness macular hole, surgical intervention via pars plana vitrectomy with peeling of the inner limiting membrane (which has been shown to improve the rate of hole closure) and intraocular gas tamponade is the best management approach.\n​\nIf the OCT showed early stage vitreomacular adhesion or vitreomacular traction without a partial or full-thickness hole, then the best management course would be to monitor or consider pharmacologic therapy with intravitreal ocriplasmin."

Incomplete posterior vitreous detachment\n2. Abnormally strong adherence of the posterior hyaloid surface to the macula\n3. Anterior traction exerted by the adhered vitreous pulling at the retinal interfaces leading to disruption of retinal architecture"
