          "explanation": "The Diagnosis is Exudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration.  With the history of drusen in both eyes in combination with the OCT findings, the likely diagnosis is exudative (wet) age-related macular degeneration with choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM). The sub-retinal hyper-reflective material (blue) likely corresponds to the CNV complex.\n\nIf left untreated, CNVM can progress to permanent vision loss through central disciform scars. Approximately 10-20% of dry age-related macular degeneration cases progress to exudative states. \n\n![](/content/media/case-4-image.png)"
