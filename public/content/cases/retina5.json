Of note, there are peri-foveal cyst-like spaces between the inner and outer retina that could represent intra-retinal fluid or pre-existing schisis given the patient's high myopia."

Towards the left side of the OCT scan, sub-retinal fluid can be seen advancing towards the fovea. The foveal contour is preserved with no sub-retinal fluid seen underneath the fovea."
