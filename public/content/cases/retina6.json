          "explanation": "**The answer is (B) X-Linked Juvenile Retinoschisis**\n\nRetinoschisis  involving the macula can be difficult to differentiate from cystoid  macular edema. On OCT, retinoschisis changes are seen as intraretinal pseudo-cystic spaces exhibiting \"strand-like\" separations (or vertical pillars) as opposed to the oval or circular shaped intra-retinal fluid in CME. To definitively differentiate these two entities, an IVFA can be performed. There will be no leakage seen on IVFA in retinoschisis.\n\n![](/content/media/case-retina6-q1a.png)"
