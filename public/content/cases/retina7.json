When traced outwards away from the fovea, the ELM cannot be identified, which is in keeping with the preferential loss of outer retinal morphology in this condition.\n\n![](/content/media/retina-7-6.webp)"

The diagnosis of cone dystrophy is suggested by progressive loss of visual acuity and colour discrimination, often accompanied by hemeralopia (day blindness) and photophobia. Genetic testing can be performed to identify the causative mutation."
