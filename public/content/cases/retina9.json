          "explanation": "The Diagnosis is Optic Pit Maculopathy.\n\n![](/content/media/retina-9-3.webp)\n\nCongenital optic pits are excavations of the optic nerve head secondary to malformation of the optic nerve during early development. It can be complicated by macular edema, schisis, or serous retinal detachment. In this patient, the most noticeable abnormality on the OCT is subretinal fluid that tracks from the optic nerve to involve the macula. When examining a patient with subretinal fluid involving the macula, it is important to rule out optic pit as a potential cause. Majority of optic pits can be found temporally.\n\nThe fundus photograph is labelled: The black arrow is pointing towards the optic pit, and the yellow arrow is pointing towards the edge of the subretinal fluid."

          "explanation": "![](/content/media/retina-9-2.webp)\n\nThere is no clear consensus regarding treatment of optic pit maculopathy. There is no evidence for anti-VEGF therapy for treatment of optic pits. Conservative management would not be appropriate given the vision of 20/200 and the associated risk of amblyopia in the pediatric population. The most commonly used intervention for the treatment of optic pit maculopathy is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV)."
