          "explanation": "APMPPE is an acquired inflammatory uveitis and an uncommon White Dot Syndrome. It is characterized by hyperreflectivity from the outer plexiform layer to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with normal retinal thickness. Some patients may have subretinal fluid or intraretinal cysts. The absence of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) may also indicate foveal involvement and correlate with the loss of visual acuity. Anterior uveitis can be present, as well as mild vitritis.\n\nReferences\n\n​Lim LL, Watzke RC, Lauer AK, Smith JR.

Other CNS disorders that are sometimes associated include optic neuritis, peripheral vestibular disorders, meningoencephalitis, seizures, venous sinus thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage, and transient ischemic attacks."

Two weeks prior, she experienced flu-like symptoms, which have now resolved. On fundus exam, there are creamy grey-white placoid lesions at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in the posterior pole.\n\n![](/content/media/uveitis-1-1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/uveitis-1-2.webp)",
