          "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is bilateral posterior scleritis (OS>OD) with anterior uveitis. Posterior scleritis is defined as involvement of the sclera posterior to the insertion of the rectus muscles. The onset of scleritis is gradual. Most patients develop severe boring or piercing eye pain over several days. This pain is characteristically dull and boring in nature and exacerbated by eye movements. Worsening of the pain during eye movement is due to the extraocular muscle insertions into the sclera. It may be worse at night and awakens the patient while sleeping. Posterior scleritis can manifest as retinal folds or striae, vascular congenstion, chorioretinal granulomas, retinal vasculitis, serous retinal detachment and macular or optic nerve edema with or without haemorrhages or cotton-wool spots. In pediatric age group, common features of posterior scleritis include concurrent anterior uveitis, disc swelling, and retinal striae. B-scan ultrasonography and orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used for the detection of posterior scleritis. Ultrasonographic changes include scleral and choroidal thickening, scleral nodules, fluid collecting in the posterior episcleral space (pathognomonic T sign), or serous retinal detachment. (1)"

  "patientPresentation": "**Contributors:** Dr. Hatim Batawi and Dr. Kamiar Mireskandari\n\nA healthy 10 year old girl presented with 2 month history of recurrent bilateral eye redness, dull aching eye pain with movement, and severe frontal headaches. The headache was usually worse at night and sometimes woke her up from sleep. Review of system was remarkable for low grade fever. Her past ocular and medical history were unremarkable. On exam, her vision was 20/20 OD and 20/25 OS. There was no RAPD OU. IOP was 15 OD and 14 OS. EOM was intact OU. Slit lamp exam showed slight conjunctival injection and 2+ cells in A/C OU.  The fundus photo of both eyes are shown below:\n\n![](/content/media/uveitis2-1.webp)",
