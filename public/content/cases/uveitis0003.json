Bilateral large intraretinal hypo-reflective cystoid cavities with a membranous structure, hyper-reflective flecks, and sub-retinal septae (yellow arrows) more prominent in the left eye. The RPE and choroid appear to have irregular contour, corresponding to RPE/choroidal folds (red arrows). Presence of subtle subretinal fluid is marked with the blue arrow."

The features of VKH depend on the stage of the disease. This case highlights the uveitic phase of VKH, which characteristically presents with panuveitis associated with optic disc edema and multiple serous retinal detachments. These features are highlighted in the OCT and the fundus photograph. CSCR is not the correct diagnosis in this case due to the presence of intraretinal cystic cavity with membraneous structure, sub-retinal septae and choroidal folds, which do not occur in CSCR."

With treatment, the sub-retinal fluid usually resolves and choroidal thickness decreases. Both of these features are used frequently in monitoring disease activity in VKH. Nerve fiber layer thickness is not a feature of VKH."

He presented with a 2-day history of new onset headache accompanied by blurred vision in both his eyes. He had a CT brain, which was normal. On examination, his vision was 20/400 OD and 20/200 OS. There was no RAPD. Slit lamp examination demonstrated a mild AC reaction.

It is classically associated with multiple serous retinal detachments.​\n2. Measuring disease activity of VKH can be monitored on OCT by observing choroidal thickness and the height of the sub-retinal fluid."
