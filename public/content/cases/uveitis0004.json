          "explanation": "There is a well-demarcated peripapillary annular band of gray-white opacification of the deep retina surrounding the optic disc in both eyes. With time, retinal vessels attenuate, and a large zone of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) depigmentation appears within the annular border."

  "patientPresentation": "**Contributors:** Dr. John Liu and Dr. Chloe Gottlieb\n\nA 26-year-old Caucasian female presents with a complaint of bilateral progressive visual field loss, worse in her left eye. She endorses photopsias in her left eye, which then rapidly progressed to her right eye within several days. She denies a prodrome and has had no recent infections, no recent travel, and no sick contacts.\n\nColour fundus photos were taken and are show below:\n\n![](/content/media/uveitis-4-1.webp)",
