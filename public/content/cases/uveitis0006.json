A comprehensive uveitis work-up for panuveitis should also be performed, including sarcoid and tuberculosis.\n\n​The patient was started on topical prednisolone 1% q2h and atropine TID OU for his cellular activity. A workup was initiated including syphilis and HIV serology. The patient then further disclosed a 2 week history of painless genital ulcers. Given his high risk sexual practices and new chancres, along with placoid chorioretinal lesion, raised the clinical suspicion for ocular syphilis.\n\n​Serology returned one week later:\n\n* RPR reactive\n* HIV serology negative"

Referring to infectious disease is the most appropriate step at this juncture.\n\nInfectious disease was consulted and started IV Penicillin G 4 million units q4h x 14 days. At the 2-week follow-up, his visual acuity was 20/20 OU with resolution of the outer retinal layer disruption and RPE lesions. His optic disc edema had resolved.

  "patientPresentation": "**Contributor:** Dr. Safwan Tayeb, MD\n\nA 63-year-old male referred by his optometrist presented with a 1-week history of blurry vision OD. His past medical history was significant for recent genital warts, but negative for systemic inflammatory conditions; past ocular history was unremarkable. The patient smokes 1/2 pack-a-day of cigarettes and disclosed that he is sexually active with multiple partners, both male and female. He does not use protection.\n​\nHis visual acuity was counting fingers OD and 20/25 OS, with normal IOP and extraocular movements. Slit lamp examination found clear corneas but 2+ AC cells OD and 1+ AC cells OS with mild conjunctival injection OU. Colour fundus photos below demonstrate OD optic disc swelling and hyperemia with a deep yellowish placoid chorioretinal lesion over the posterior pole involving the macula.\n\n![](/content/media/uveitis-6-1.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/uveitis-6-2.webp)",
