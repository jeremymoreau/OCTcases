          "explanation": "The right fundus shows peri-papillary atrophy and a tilted optic disc.  The rest of the fundus is otherwise unremarkable. The left fundus shows multiple well-circumscribed yellow punctate chorio-retinal lesions clustered around the posterior pole and optic nerve with atrophic hyper-pigmented scars. Auto-fluorescence reveals distinct hypo-autofluorescent lesions corresponding to the lesions seen on fundus examination."

          "explanation": "All of the above conditions can present with similar features such as punched-out chorioretinal lesions, peripapillary atrophy, and a choroidal neovascular membrane.  This makes the diagnosis very difficult, especially when the lesions are inactive.\n\n​The clinical characteristics of the lesions can help in making the diagnosis.  Punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) lesions are usually smaller than those seen in multifocal choroiditis (MFC) and ocular histoplasmosis syndrome and rarely extend to the mid-periphery.  In contrast, lesions in multifocal choroiditis or ocular histoplasmosis tend to involve the mid-periphery. Most importantly, PIC is characterized by the absence of ocular inflammation such as anterior segment cells and flare or vitritis.  PIC tends to be bilateral (80%) and predominantly affect young females (90%) who are myopic. Based on this, the working diagnosis is punctate inner choroidopathy."

          "explanation": "The OCT macula of the right eye is normal.  The OCT macula of the left eye shows a localized disruption of the outer retinal layers and RPE (yellow arrow). The outer retina appears to herniate (V-shaped appearance) towards the RPE/BM complex, which is in keeping with an inactive lesion of PIC on OCT. \n\n![](/content/media/uveitis8_7.webp)\n\nZhang et al. described the natural course of PIC using SD-OCT, which they divided into 5 stages. The stages are described below alongside a Figure from their article.\n\n​Stage 1: Slight irregularities in the outer nuclear layer.\n\nStage 2: Focal elevation of the RPE with a corresponding inner segment/outer segment interface disruption.\n\nStage 3: The nodule with moderate reflectivity breaks through the RPE and then sprouts toward and replaces the photoreceptor layer until it reaches and domes the OPL. The RPE relics and BM at the break gradually disappear, uncovering the choroidal part of the nodule.\n\nStage 4: The nodule regresses from the apex toward the choroidal part, followed by an incarcerated herniation of the OPL and inner retina (with a V-shaped appearance) through the break in the RPE and BM.\n\nStage 5: The photoreceptor layer around the lesion is gradually lost with the sagging of the OPL and inner retina. Meanwhile, RPE proliferation (with posterior shadowing) repairs the RPE break and relieves the retinal hernia, making the OPL outline reappear.\n\n![](/content/media/uveitis8_8.webp)\n\nReference:\n\nZhang X, Zuo C, Li M, Chen H, Huang S, Wen F.

      "answers": [
        {
          "correct": true,
          "answerText": "A. Choroidal neovascular membrane",
          "explanation": "The most common complication associated with punctate inner choroidopathy is the formation of a choroidal neovascular membrane.  A fluorescein angiography can be performed to help identify a CNVM which would show early hyper-fluorescence with leakage / staining of active lesions.  The presence of CNVM in PIC is often what leads to poor visual acuity in these patients.  Presence of CNVM is associated with poor visual prognosis and indicates the need for treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF.  Serous retinal detachments can be seen in PIC and is more commonly seen in areas of confluent lesions. Complications such as macular edema and epiretinal membrane are less frequently seen."
