This layer is not disrupted in this case. \nB)    The OPL synapses between photoreceptors, bipolar cells and horizontal cells. It is the site of cystic macular edema but is not disrupted in this OCT.\nD)    The choriocapillaris is a part of the choroid containing capillaries that supply blood to Bruch’s membrane and the RPE.

          "explanation": "ARPE or Krill’s disease is an idiopathic retinopathy typically occurring in young adults (ages 10-40) that was first described by Dr. Krill in 1972. The classic finding on OCT is a dome-shaped hyperreflective lesion at the photoreceptor outer segment layer disrupting the ellipsoid zone and interdigitation zone. Typically, there is no leakage on fluorescein angiography.\n\nIncorrect answers: \nA) MEWDS can present with hypopigmented lesions in the macula which typically are hyperfluorescent on IVFA and have a wreath-like configuration which is not present in this patient.\nC) Solar retinopathy can present with disruption of the interdigitation zone, but a history of sun gazing should be elicited.\nD) Acute idiopathic maculopathy (AIM) shows swelling of outer retina with presence of hyper-reflective exudation and hypo-reflective fluid in the subretinal space. \n\nReferences: \nStéphanie Baillif 1, Benjamin Wolff, Vincent Paoli, Pierre Gastaud, Martine Mauget-Faÿsse.

          "explanation": "ARPE is a self-limiting disease with spontaneous improvement. Up to 89% of patients recover vision back to baseline within 2 months.\n\nIncorrect answers:\n\nA) Intravitreal anti-VEGF injection is commonly used to treat diabetic macular edema and cystoid macular edema related to retinal vein occlusion or age related macular degeneration. There is no edema in this case and injection would not be needed.\n\nB) Focal laser can be applied to localized areas of capillary leakage causing exudation or edema that affects vision. These features are not present in this patient.\n\nD) Bloodwork for inflammatory retinal conditions can help identifying an underlying cause in cases of uveitis. No signs of inflammation such as vitritis, retinitis or vasculitis are present.\n\n​Reference:\n\nCho HJ, Han SY, Cho SW, Lee DW, Lee TG, Kim CG, Kim JW.
