          "explanation": "Fundus photos demonstrate retinal atrophy throughout the peripapillary region extending inferiorly OD, as well as atrophy extending superonasally OS. The nasal macula is affected OD, and the entire macula, including the fovea, is affected OS. Fundus autofluorescence demonstrates hypoautofluorescence throughout the atrophic lesions seen on fundus photography with a halo of hyper-autofluorescence around the edges of the lesions. This hyperautofluorescence along the edges most likely represents “sick-RPE” cells, a marker of disease activity."

There is also discontinuity of the ellipsoid zone and breaks in the RPE layer (blue arrow). There are no subretinal hyporeflective areas suggestive of subretinal fluid. The inner retinal layers are grossly in-tact outside of areas of retinal atrophy. There are no suggestions of choroidal neovascularization on OCT imaging or fundus imaging.\n\n![](/content/media/uveitis_13_6.webp)"

          "answerText": "B. Serpiginous chorioretinopathy",
          "explanation": "Serpiginous chorioretinopathy is a rare posterior uveitic disease process which is typically classified as a “White-Dot Syndrome”. More common in males than females, this condition typically presents with painless vision loss, metamorphopsia, floaters and central scotomas. Fundus examination typically demonstrates gray-yellow subretinal infiltrates and atrophy that spread centrifugally from the peripapillary region (like a snake or “serpiginous” fashion). Active lesions lead to RPE and choroidal atrophy. Choroidal neovascularization can be seen in 35% of cases and leads to further vision loss. Fundus autofluorescence is a crucial imaging modality, as hyperautofluorescence at the edges of atrophic lesions indicate activity of disease. Serpiginous chorioretinopathy has poor visual prognosis. Although there are no known systemic associations with serpiginous chorioretinopathy, it is always important to exclude tuberculosis. A full uveitis workup to exclude infectious and inflammatory causes is indicated in all cases of serpiginous chorioretinopathy.\n\n​References:\n\nNazari Khanamiri H, Rao NA.

          "answerText": "D. Systemic steroids with long term immunomodulatory therapy",
          "explanation": "The aim of treatment for serpiginous chorioretinopathy is to reduce chorioretinal inflammation and prevent the progression of active disease lesions, especially when these lesions are threatening the fovea (such as in the right eye for our patient). Acute treatment requires systemic oral steroids or local periocular steroid injections, and due to the high rate of recurrence of this disease, long term immunosuppression is indicated. Steroid-sparing antimetabolites, such as methotrexate and azathioprine, or anti-TNF agents such as Humira or Remicade are common treatment modalities. Alkylating agents such as chlorambucil have also shown good results. Despite long-term treatment, approximately 25% of patients end up with vision less than 20/200.\n\nReferences:\n\nEbrahimiadib N, Modjtahedi BS, Davoudi S, Foster CS.

  "patientPresentation": "A 61-year-old Caucasian man was referred to a uveitis clinic for atypical retinal findings OU. The patient was being treated for neovascular age-related macular degeneration for the previous 2 years. He was initially diagnosed with dry AMD due to peripapillary drusenoid changes, but after 1 year of monitoring, he developed choroidal neovascularization. The referring retinal specialist was concerned for the progression of RPE changes in the peripapillary region. The choroidal neovascularization was quiescent after 4 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections at the time of presentation.\n\nThe patient noted decreased vision over the last 6 months with floaters OS > OD. He denied flashes, visual field deficit, and trauma. He denied any past medical or ocular history. Review of systems was negative. His visual acuity was 20/100 OD and CF OS. IOP was within normal limits and there was no RAPD.
