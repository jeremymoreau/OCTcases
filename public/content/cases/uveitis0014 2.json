          "answerText": "A. Fungal endophthalmitis",
          "explanation": "Fungal endophthalmitis is a rare intraocular infection caused by endogenous and exogenous sources. Exogenous infections typically result from penetrating trauma or intraocular surgery. Endogenous infections typically develop in immunocompromised individuals or those with risk factors such as indwelling intravenous catheters, recent surgery, prolonged corticosteroid use, malignancy, certain metabolic conditions, or intravenous drug use. Fungal endophthalmitis classically presents with slowly progressive focal vitritis overlying chorioretinal lesions. Lesions are often numerous, bilateral, small, white, and well-circumscribed, especially in infections caused by Candida species. If left untreated, these infections penetrate the blood-retina barrier and extend into the retina and vitreous from the choroid. Over time, these lesions can become significantly elevated extension into the vitreous cavity. Vitreous extension or “seeding” may present with “puffy” fungal balls adjacent to one another in a \"string of pearls\" configuration, as seen in the slit lamp photograph focused on the vitreous cavity in this patient.\n\n​References:\n\n1.

          "explanation": "Early or mild cases presenting with flat choroidal lesions and minimal retinal or vitreous involvement can be managed with systemic anti-fungal therapy as the infection is predominantly outside the blood-retina barrier. Moderate or severe cases with macula-involving or vision-threatening lesions and significant vitritis are best managed with combined intravitreal and systemic anti-fungals. A vitrectomy can aid in diagnosis and debulking of fungal elements, and possibly also reduce the incidence of post-infectious sequelae like tractional retinal detachments and epiretinal membrane.\n\nReferences:\n\n1.
