There is also hyper-reflectivity in the outer nuclear layer extending towards the RPE (red arrows), which can also be seen in the acute phase of this condition. The left eye OCT macula was unremarkable.\n\n![](/content/media/uveitis_16_3.webp)"

          "explanation": "The key finding of the IVFA images is hypofluorescence, from blockage of the signal by the placoid lesions (blue arrows), followed by hyperfluorescence via staining in late phases (red arrows). There are neither regions that demonstrate hyperfluorescence early, nor hyperfluorescence that increases in size and intensity in keeping with leakage; one can also correlate a lack of leakage to a paucity of intra- and subretinal fluid on OCT imaging.\n\n![](/content/media/699564_ec6f177e46c7491a8f713d09940a1536~mv2.webp)\n\n![](/content/media/699564_9df089e54eb745a692db7b08c5ce0ebe~mv2.webp)"

          "answerText": "D. Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE)",
          "explanation": "APMPPE is an inflammatory chorioretinopathy that is classified as a “white-dot syndrome.” APMPPE is typically bilateral and presents in patients in their 2nd - 4th generation of life. There is no sex predilection. Patients typically present with central or paracentral scotomas, as well as photopsias. There is occasionally a viral prodrome leading up to visual changes. Classic findings on fundus examination are large gray-white or creamy lesions at the level of the RPE. OCT imaging classically demonstrates loss of the ellipsoid zone with hyper-reflectivity in the outer retina and RPE mottling. The classic presentation on IVFA imaging is “early blockage with late staining,” as seen in our patient. Luckily, cases of APMPPE are typically self-resolving, with vision returning in 4-8 weeks. Steroids may hasten visual recovery, but there is no consensus on treatment. If there is poor visual rehabilitation or recurrence, an alternative diagnosis of relentless placoid chorioretinitis should be investigated."

          "explanation": "All patients with a new diagnosis of APMPPE should undergo a full neurological work-up for CNS vasculitis and associated conditions. Reports of optic neuritis, intracerebral hemorrhage, and encephalitis have been reported, but are less prevalent than CNS vasculitis. If relentless placoid chorioretinitis is believed to be the diagnosis, referral to Rheumatology for possible systemic immunosuppression should be initiated."

The patient noted 1 week of seeing “gray patches” in her central vision OD. She denied pain, flashes, floaters of a visual field deficit. There was no viral prodrome. She denied past medical or ocular history. Review of systems was negative. Visual acuity was 20/70 OD and 20/20 OS. There was no RAPD. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable.
