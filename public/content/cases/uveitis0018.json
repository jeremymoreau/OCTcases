          "answerText": "A. Radial hyper-reflective foci in Henle’s fibre layer",
          "explanation": "The radial hyperreflective foci on OCT centered around the fovea represent hard exudates in the outer plexiform layer (Henle’s fibre layer). This is arranged in a macular star pattern, which is described a “petaloid pattern.” Cotton wool spots (RNFL) and photoreceptor disruption (EZ) would localize differently on OCT, and subretinal hemorrhage would appear as hyper-reflective material under the neurosensory retina, not in Henle’s layer."

          "explanation": "The patient has both macular star and mild optic disc edema. The left eye was normal. The macular star and mild optic disc edema is consistent with a neuroretinitis. In these cases, the macular star typically occurs 1-2 weeks after onset of disc edema and occurs due to inflammation of the optic disc vasculature."

          "explanation": "While neuroretinitis may be the most common, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), optic disc and juxtapupillary tumours, atypical optic neuritis (ex. MOG), papilledema and hypertensive retinopathy, can all produce macular star with optic disc edema."

          "answerText": "D. Any of the above",
          "explanation": "Any of the above treatment options can be done in this case. Although the serologies for Bartonella were negative, it is possible that early phase IgM had not peaked by this period – some physicians elect to place patients with neuro-retinitis on empiric antibiotics (ex. Ciprofloxacin 500mg BID x 7-10d) while awaiting serologies. If serologies and infectious work-up are negative, the presumptive diagnosis is idiopathic neuroretinitis for which oral steroids with quick taper can be used. Observation is a reasonable option as well in cases without atypical features (abnormal neuro-imaging, neurologic symptoms, slow recovery, severe presentation)."
