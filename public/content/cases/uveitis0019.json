          "answerText": "C. Birdshot Chorioretinopathy",
          "explanation": "Birdshot chorioretinopathy is a white-dot syndrome that often presents with bilateral cream-colored oval chorioretinal lesions in the peripapillary area. The lesions are typically oriented around the optic nerve head. OCT may demonstrate disruption of the ellipsoid zone which contributes to vision loss (1). Cystoid macular edema and vitreous cells may also be present, which can impact visual acuity."

          "answerText": "A. HLA-A29",
          "explanation": "The HLA-A29 haplotype exhibits the strongest correlation between a human class I MHC molecule and any disease. Between 80% and 98% of patients with birdshot chorioretinitis are HLA-A29 positive, compared to 7% in the general population, and this positivity is associated with a 224-fold increase in the relative risk of developing the disease (2). HLA-B27 is associated with ankylosing spondylitis and anterior uveitis, while HLA-B51 is linked to Behçet’s disease. HLA-DR1 and HLA-DR4 are associated with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease."

There is extensive dye leakage in all zones of the retina, suggestive of retinal vasculitis (yellow arrows). The chorioretinal lesions in birdshot chorioretinopathy classically demonstrate early blockage with late staining on IVFA. Indocyanine green (ICG) angiography may reveal even more lesions than are visible clinically or on IVFA.\n\n![](/content/media/uveitis_19_9.avif)"
