Early fundus exam may appear normal, but OCT and fundus autofluorescence reveal characteristic outer retinal disruption and a trizonal FAF pattern. The etiology is unclear, with autoimmune and viral mechanisms proposed, and management remains uncertain, though some cases stabilize spontaneously."

While some patients remain stable or improve, others may experience slow progression over time, and visual recovery can be variable. Bilateral involvement can occur, but is usually sequential."

Immunosuppressive and antiviral agents may be considered in select, refractory cases, but are not typically first-line."
